shores of my Eastern Sea,Heard over the waves the little 
voice,Saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wail- ing, 
amid the roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling 
buildings;Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters 
running —nor from the single corpses, nor those in heaps, 
nor those borne away in the tumbrils;Was not so desperate 
at the battues of death—was not so shock'd at the 
repeated fusillades of the guns.23 Pale, silent, stern, what could 
I say to that long- accrued retribution?Could I wish humanity 
different?Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?Or 
that there be no justice in destiny or time?34 O 
Liberty! O mate for me!Here too the blaze, the grape-shot 
and the axe, in re- serve, to fetch them out 
in case of need;Here too, though long represt, can never 
be destroy'd;Here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic;Here 
too demanding full arrears of vengeance.45 Hence I sign this 
salute over the sea,And I do not deny that terrible 
red birth and baptism,But remember the little voice that I 
heard wailing—and wait with perfect trust, no matter how long;And 
from to-day, sad and cogent, I maintain the be- queath'd 
cause, as for all lands,And I send these words to 
Paris with my love,And I guess some chansonniers there will 
understand them,For I guess there is latent music yet in 
France—floods of it;O I hear already the bustle of instruments—they 
will soon be drowning all that would interrupt them;O I 
think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,It 
reaches hither—it swells me to joyful madness,I will run transpose 
it in words, to justify it,I will yet sing a 
song for you, MA FEMME. EUROPE,The 72d and 73d Years 
of These States.11 SUDDENLY, out of its stale and drowsy
