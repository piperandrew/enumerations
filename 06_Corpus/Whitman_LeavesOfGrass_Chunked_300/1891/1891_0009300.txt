canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at 
his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread, The conductor beats 
time for the band and all the performers follow him, 
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first 
professions, The regatta is spread on the bay, the race 
is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!) The drover watching 
his drove sings out to them that would stray, The 
pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser

white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly, The 
opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips, The prostitute 
draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and 
pimpled neck, The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the

not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;) The President 
holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries, 
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with

of halibut in the hold, The Missourian crosses the plains 
toting his wares and his cattle, As the fare-collector goes 
through the train he gives notice by the jingling of 
loose change, The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners 
are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar, 
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the 
laborers; Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd, 
it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon 
and small arms!) Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, 
the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground; 
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by 
the hole in the frozen surface, The stumps stand thick
