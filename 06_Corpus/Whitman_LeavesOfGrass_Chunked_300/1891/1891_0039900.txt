indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant com- 
pany of singers, and their words, The words of the 
singers are the hours or minutes of the light or 
dark, but the words of the maker of poems are 
the general light and dark, The maker of poems settles 
justice, reality, immortality, His insight and power encircle things and 
the human race, He is the glory and extract thus 
far of things and of the human race. The singers 
do not beget, only the Poet begets, The singers are 
welcom'd, understood, appear often enough, but rare has the day 
been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker 
of poems, the Answerer, (Not every century nor every five 
centuries has contain'd such a day, for all its names.)The 
singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, 
but the name of each of them is one of 
the singers, The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer, 
sweet- singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer, weird-singer, or something else. All

true poems, The words of true poems do not merely 
please, The true poets are not followers of beauty but 
the august masters of beauty; The greatness of sons is 
the exuding of the greatness of mothers and fathers, The 
words of true poems are the tuft and final applause 
of science. Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of 
reason, health, rudeness of body, withdrawnness, Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such 
are some of the words of poems. The sailor and 
traveler underlie the makers of poems, the Answerer, The builder, 
geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all these underlie the maker 
of poems, the Answerer. The words of the true poems 
give you more than poems, They give you to form
