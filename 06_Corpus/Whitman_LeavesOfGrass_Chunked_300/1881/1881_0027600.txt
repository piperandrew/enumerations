days were far away through fields, in woods, on hills, 
he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain apart 
from other men, Who oft as he saunter'd the streets 
curv'd with his arm the shoul der of his friend, 
while the arm of his friend rested upon him also. 
WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY.WHEN I 
heard at the close of the day how my name 
had been receiv'd with plaudits in the capitol, still it 
was not a happy night for me that follow'd, And 
else when I carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, 
still I was not happy, But the day when I 
rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh'd, 
singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn, When I saw 
the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear 
in the morning light, When I wander'd alone over the 
beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and 
saw the sun rise, And when I thought how my 
dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O 
then I was happy, O then each breath tasted sweeter, 
and all that day my food nourish'd me more, and 
the beautiful day pass'd well, And the next came with 
equal joy, and with the next at evening came my 
friend, And that night while all was still I heard 
the waters roll slowly continually up the shores, I heard 
the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed 
to me whispering to congratulate me, For the one I 
love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover 
in the cool night, In the stillness in the autumn 
moonbeams his face was inclined toward me, And his arm 
lay lightly around my breast—and that night I was happy.
