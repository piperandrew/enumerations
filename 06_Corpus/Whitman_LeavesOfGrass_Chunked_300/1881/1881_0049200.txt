what you are picks its way. FRANCE,The 18th Year of 
these States.A GREAT year and place,A harsh discordant natal scream 
out-sounding, to touch the mother's heart closer than any yet. 
I walk'd the shores of my Eastern sea,Heard over the 
waves the little voice,Saw the divine infant where she woke 
mournfully wailing, amid the roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash 
of falling buildings, Was not so sick from the blood 
in the gutters running, nor from the single corpses, nor 
those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils, 
Was not so desperate at the battues of death—was not 
so shock'd at the repeated fusillades of the guns. Pale, 
silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued retribu- 
tion? Could I wish humanity different?Could I wish the people 
made of wood and stone?Or that there be no justice 
in destiny or time?O Liberty! O mate for me!Here too 
the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve, to 
fetch them out in case of need, Here too, though 
long represt, can never be destroy'd,Here too could rise at 
last murdering and ecstatic,Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.Hence 
I sign this salute over the sea,And I do not 
deny that terrible red birth and baptism,But remember the little 
voice that I heard wailing, and wait with perfect trust, 
no matter how long, And from to-day sad and cogent 
I maintain the bequeath'd cause, as for all lands, And 
I send these words to Paris with my love,And I 
guess some chansonniers there will understand them,For I guess there 
is latent music yet in France, floods of it,O I 
hear already the bustle of instruments, they will soon be 
drowning all that would interrupt them, O I think the 
east wind brings a triumphal and free march,It reaches hither,
