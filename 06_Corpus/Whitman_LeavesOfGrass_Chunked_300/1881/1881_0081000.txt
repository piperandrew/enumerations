heaps and windrows, well out from the water, the green-back'd 
spotted mossbonkers. 352 FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT. THOU ORB 
ALOFT FULL-DAZZLING.THOU orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!Flooding with 
sheeny light the gray beach sand,The sibilant near sea with 
vistas far and foam,And tawny streaks and shades and spreading 
blue;O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.Hear 
me illustrious!Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,Even 
as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood 
edge, thy touching-distant beams enough, Or man matured, or young 
or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation. 
(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,I know before 
the fitting man all Nature yields,Though answering not in words, 
the skies, trees, hear his voice— and thou O sun, 
As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts 
of flame gigantic, I understand them, I know those flames, 
those perturbations well.)Thou that with fructifying heat and light,O'er myriad 
farms, o'er lands and waters North and South,O'er Mississippi's endless 
course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kana- da's woods, O'er all 
the globe that turns its face to thee shining in 
space,Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas,Thou that 
to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so 
liberally, Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but 
a fleeting ray out of thy million millions, Strike through 
these chants.Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength 
for these,Prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthen- 
ing shadows, Prepare my starry nights. FACES.SAUNTERING the pavement or 
riding the country by-road, lo, such faces! Faces of friendship, 
precision, caution, suavity, ideality,The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common 
benevo- lent face, The face of the singing of music, 
the grand faces of natural law- yers and judges broad
