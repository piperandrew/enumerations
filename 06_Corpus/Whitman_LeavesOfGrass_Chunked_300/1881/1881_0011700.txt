the buds beneath you are folded?Waiting in gloom, protected by 
frost,The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,I underlying causes to 
balance them at last,My knowledge my live parts, it keeping 
tally with the meaning of all things, Happiness, (which whoever 
hears me let him or her set out in search

premonitory tinkles and color'd lights, The steam-whistle, the solid roll 
of the train of approaching cars,The slow march play'd at 
the head of the association marching two and two, (They 
go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with
