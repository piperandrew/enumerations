preparation and accretion,And of the threads that connect the stars, 
and of wombs and of the father-stuff, And of the 
rights of them the others are down upon,Of the deform'd, 
trivial, flat, foolish, despised,Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls 
of dung.Through me forbidden voices,Voices of sexes and lusts, voices 
veil'd and I remove the veil,Voices indecent by me clarified 
and transfigur'd.I do not press my fingers across my mouth,I 
keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head 
and heart,Copulation is no more rank to me than death 
is.I believe in the flesh and the appetites,Seeing, hearing, feeling, 
are miracles, and each part and tag of me is 
a miracle. Divine am I inside and out, and I 
make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from, The 
scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,This head more 
than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.If I worship one 
thing more than another it shall be the spread of 
my own body, or any part of it, Translucent mould 
of me it shall be you!Shaded ledges and rests it 
shall be you!Firm masculine colter it shall be you!Whatever goes 
to the tilth of me it shall be you!You my 
rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!Breast 
that presses against other breasts it shall be you!My brain 
it shall be your occult convolutions!Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous 
pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you! 
Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be 
you!Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall 
be you!Sun so generous it shall be you!Vapors lighting and 
shading my face it shall be you!You sweaty brooks and 
dews it shall be you!Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against 
me it shall be you!Broad muscular fields, branches of live
