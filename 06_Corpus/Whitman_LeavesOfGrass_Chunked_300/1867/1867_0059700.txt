or through swamps; Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, 
the Altama- haw, the Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee, the 
Coosa, and the Sabine; O pensive, far away wandering, I 
return with my Soul to haunt their banks again; Again 
in Florida I float on transparent lakes—I float on the 
Okeechobee—I cross the hummock land, or through pleasant openings, or 
dense forests; I see the parrots in the woods—I see 
the papaw tree and the blossoming titi; Again, sailing in 
my coaster, on deck, I coast off Georgia—I coast up 
the Carolinas,I see where the live-oak is growing—I see where 
the yellow-pine, the scented bay-tree, the lemon and orange, the 
cypress, the graceful palmetto; I pass rude sea-headlands and enter 
Pamlico Sound through an inlet, and dart my vision inland; 
O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, 
hemp!The cactus, guarded with thorns—the laurel-tree, with large white flowers; 
The range afar—the richness and barrenness—the old woods charged with 
mistletoe and trailing moss,The piney odor and the gloom—the awful 
natural stillness, (Here in these dense swamps the free- booter 
carries his gun, and the fugitive slave has his conceal'd 
hut;)O the strange fascination of these half-known, half- impassable swamps, 
infested by reptiles, re- sounding with the bellow of the 
alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl and the wild-cat, 
and the whirr of the rattlesnake; The mocking-bird, the American 
mimic, singing all the forenoon—singing through the moon-lit night,The humming-bird, 
the wild-turkey, the raccoon, the opossum; A Tennessee corn-field—the tall, 
graceful, long-leav'd corn—slender, flapping, bright green, with tassels—with beautiful ears, 
each well-sheath'd in its husk; An Arkansas prairie—a sleeping lake, 
or still bayou;O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs—I 
can stand them not—I will depart; O to be a 
Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian!O
