going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;Adorning myself 
to bestow myself on the first that will take me; 
Not asking the sky to come down to my good 
will;Scattering it freely forever.1577 The pure contralto sings in the 
organ loft;The carpenter dresses his plank—the tongue of his foreplane 
whistles its wild ascending lisp; The married and unmarried children 
ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner; The pilot seizes the

The young fellow drives the express-wagon—(I love him, though I 
do not know him;)The half-breed straps on his light boots 
to compete in the race; The western turkey-shooting draws old 
and young— some lean on their rifles, some sit on
