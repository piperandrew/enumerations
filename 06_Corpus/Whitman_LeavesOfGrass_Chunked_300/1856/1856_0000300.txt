possess the good of the earth and sun — there 
are millions of suns left,You shall no longer take things 
at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes 
of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,You 
shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things 
from me,You shall listen to all sides, and filter them 
from yourself.I have heard what the talkers were talking, the 
talk of the beginning and the end,But I do not 
talk of the beginning or the end. There was never 
any more inception than there is now,Nor any more youth

any more perfection than there is now,Nor any more heaven 
or hell than there is now. Urge, and urge, and

the dimness opposite equals advance — always substance and increase, 
always sex,Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a

a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, I and this mystery here 
we stand. Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear 
and sweet is all that is not my soul.Lack one 
lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,Till 
that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its turn.Showing the 
best and dividing it from the worst, age vexes age,Knowing 
the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss 
I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.Welcome is 
every organ and attribute of me, and of any man 
hearty and clean,Not an inch nor a particle of an 
inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than
