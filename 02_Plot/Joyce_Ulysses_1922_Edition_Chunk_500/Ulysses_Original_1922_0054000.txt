Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know. — 
Go away! Isn’t that grand for her? — Yes, in 
a photographer’s there. Getting on like a house on fire. 
How are all your charges? — All on the baker’s 
list, Mrs Breen said. How many has she? No other 
in sight. — You’re in black I see. You have 
no… — No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come 
from a funeral. Going to crop up all day, I 
foresee. Who’s dead, when and what did he die of? 
Turn up like a bad penny. — O dear me, 
Mrs Breen said, I hope it wasn’t any near relation. 
May as well get her sympathy. — Dignam, Mr Bloom 
said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, 
poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning. 
Your funeral’s tomorrow While you’re coming through the rye. Diddlediddle 
dumdum Diddlediddle… — Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs 
Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily. Now that’s quite enough about that. 
Just quietly : husband. — And your lord and master? 
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn’t lost 
them anyhow. — O, don’t be talking, she said. He’s 
a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s in there now with his 
lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me 
heartscalded. Wait till I show you. Hot mockturtle vapour and 
steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison’s. The 
heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet. Want 
to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or 
they’d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it 
from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing 
in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. 
Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork 
chained to the table. Opening her handbag, chipped leather hatpin 
: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick 
it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. 
Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise 
Cain. Husband barging. Where’s the ten shillings I gave you 
on Monday? Ave you feeding your little brother’s family? Soiled 
handkerchief : medicinebottle. Pastile that was fell. What is she?… 
— There must be a new moon out, she said. 
He’s always bad then. Do you know what he did 
last night? Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed 
themselves on him wide in alarm, yet smiling. — What? 
Mr Bloom asked. Let her speak. Look straight in her 
eyes. I believe you. Trust me. — Woke me up 
in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare. 
Indiges. — Said the ace of spades was walking up 
the stairs. — The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said. 
She took a folded postcard from her handbag. — Read 
that, she said. He got it this morning. — What
