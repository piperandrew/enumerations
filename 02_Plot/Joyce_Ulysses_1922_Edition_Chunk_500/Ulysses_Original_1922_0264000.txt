sun naked like a God or something and then plunging 
into the sea with them why arent all men like 
that thered be some consolation for a woman like that 
lovely little statue he bought I could look at him 
all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger 
up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry 
for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him 
all over also his lovely young cock there so simple 
I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody 
was looking as if it was asking you to suck 
it so clean and white he looked with his boyish 
face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if 
some of it went down what its only like gruel 
or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so 
clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never 
dream of washing it from 1 years end to the 
other the most of them only thats what gives the 
women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I 
can only get in with a handsome young poet at 
my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the 
morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or 
Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he 
comes out Ill read and study all I can find 
or learn a bit off by heart if I knew 
who he likes so he wont think me stupid if 
he thinks all women are the same and I can 
teach him the other part Ill make him feel all 
over him till he half faints nnder me then hell 
write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 
2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous 
O but then what am I going to do about 
him though no thats no way for him has he 
no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his 
nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because 
I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know 
poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not 
keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes 
and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced 
without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way 
in the half of a shirt they wear to be 
admired like a priest or a butcher or those old 
hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes 
right enough in his way to pass the time as 
a joke sure you might as well be in bed 
with what with a lion God Im sure hed have 
something better to say for himself an old Lion would 
O well I suppose its because they were so plump 
and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they 
excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount 
of pleasure they get off a womans body were so
