you that fellow in the pit at the pit at 
the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time 
Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for 
any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me 
there and looking away hes a bit daft I think 
I saw him after trying to get near two stylish 
dressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game 
I recognised him on the moment the face and everything 
but he didnt remember me and she didnt even want 
me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well 
I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her 
the way I did when she was down with the 
mumps her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of 
course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came 
properly till I was what 22 or so it went 
into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense 
and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white 
ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped 
when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome 
then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper 
I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love 
if a man gives up his life for her that 
way for nothing I suppose there are few men like 
that left its hard to believe in it though unless 
it really happened to me the majority of them with 
not a particle of love in their natures to find 
two people like that nowadays full up of each other 
that would feel the same way as you do theyre 
usually a bit foolish in the head his father must 
have been a bit queer to go and poison himself 
after her still poor old man I suppose he felt 
lost always making love to my things too the few 
old rags I have wanting to put her hair up 
at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on 
her shes time enough for that all her life after 
of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips 
so red a pity they wont stay that way I 
was too but theres no use going to the fair 
with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I 
asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes 
the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches 
and she pretended not to see us in her trap 
with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I 
gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for 
herself take that now for answering me like that and 
that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of 
course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it 
there was a weed in the tea or I didnt 
sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and 
I told her over and over again not to leave
