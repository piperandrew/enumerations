his money of course he has to pay for it 
from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope 
theyll have something better for us in the other world 
tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for 
tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me 
of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it 
often enough and he thinks father bought it form Lord 
Napier that I used to admire when I was a 
little girl because I told him easy piano O I 
like my bed God here we are as bad as 
ever after 16 years how many houses were we in 
at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street 
and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time 
were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs 
march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks 
of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and 
worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing 
always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after 
them always know who was in there last every time 
were just getting on right something happens or he puts 
his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr 
Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into 
prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be 
all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well 
have him coming home with the sack soon out of 
the Freeman too like the rest on account of those 
Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the 
little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet 
all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him 
much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely 
Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the 
trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells 
wait 3 quarters the hour wait 2 oclock well thats 
a nice hour of the night for him to be 
coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area 
if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little 
habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see 
or Ill see if he has that French letter still 
in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know 
deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their 
lies then why should we tell them even if its 
the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in 
bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought 
me another time as if we hadnt enough of that 
in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his 
name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children 
with two heads and no legs thats the kind of 
villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in 
their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the 
half of them then tea and toast for him buttered
