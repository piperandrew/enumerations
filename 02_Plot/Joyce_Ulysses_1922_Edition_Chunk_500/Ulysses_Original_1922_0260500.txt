or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening 
that night it came on me like that the one 
and only tim ewe were in a box that Michael 
Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband 
at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him 
Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt 
give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at 
me with his glasses and him the other side of 
me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I 
suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I 
could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I 
was interested having to sit it out then to the 
last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in 
a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery 
that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he 
shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in 
the next lane running round all the back ways after 
to make up for it I wish he had what 
I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself 
is better off than us have we too much blood 
up in us or what O patience above its pouring 
out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make 
me pregnant as big as he is I dont want 
to ruin the clean sheets the clean linen I wore 
brought it on too damn it damn it and they 
always want to see a stain on the bed to 
know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them 
theyre such fools too you could be a widow or 
divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would 
do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy 
let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin 
whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and 
cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like 
the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over 
the other side of the park till I suggested to 
put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under 
my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day 
I think it is easy I think Ill cut all 
this hair off me there scalding me I might look 
like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin 
the next time he turned up my clothes on me 
Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber 
gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under 
me after that old commode I wonder was I too 
heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on 
the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse 
and skirt first in the other room he was so 
busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me 
I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits 
easy God I remember one time I could scout it
