roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and 
they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered 
was he that he would suffer nought to grow in 
all the land but green grass for himself (for that 
was the only colour to his mind) and there was 
a board put up on a hillock in the middle 
of the island with a printed notice, saying : By 
the lord Harry green is the grass that grows on 
the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got 
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of 
Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as 
much as a handful of mustard or a bag of 
rapeseed out he run amok over half the countryside rooting 
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by 
lord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at 
first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer 
Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an 
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and 
I’ll meddle in his matters, says he. I’ll make that 
animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that 
good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says 
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal 
pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he 
had spade oars for himself but the first rule of 
the course was that the others were to row with 
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a 
bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he 
kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he 
was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of 
the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for 
boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the 
lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in 
the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out 
again told them all his new name. Then, with the 
water running off him, he got into an old smock 
and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought 
a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he 
could never learn a word of it except the first 
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off 
by heart and if ever he went out for a 
walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it 
up on what took his fancy, the side of a 
rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton 
or a corkfloat. In short he and the bull of 
Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and 
a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end 
was that the men of the island, seeing no help 
was toward as the ungrate women were all of one 
mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles 
of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the
