only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes 
Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting 
enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting 
butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and 
rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the 
very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all 
gave 5/ each and or let him pay and invite 
some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove 
out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed 
have him examining all the horses toenails first like he 
does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes 
with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are 
little houses down at the bottom of the banks there 
on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says 
not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of 
Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is 
a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him 
better the seaside but Id never again in this life 
get into a boat with him after him at Bray 
telling the boatmen he knew how to row if anyone 
asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup 
hed say yes then it came on to get rough 
the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down 
my side telling me to pull the right reins now 
pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods 
in through through the bottom and his oar slipping out 
of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned 
he can swim of course me no theres no danger 
whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like 
to have tattered them down off him before all the 
people and give him what that one calls flagellate till 
he was black and blue do him all the good 
in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont 
know who he is with that other beauty Burke out 
of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as 
usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if 
there was a row on youd vomit a better face 
there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation 
I wonder what kind is that book he brought me 
Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other 
Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that 
nickname going about with his tube from one woman to 
another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all 
ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with 
that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying 
and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me 
of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay 
round the back of the rock they were fine all 
silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred 
they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap
