murmur of approval arose from all and some were for 
ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which 
would have been effected nor would he have received more 
than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression 
by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a 
round hand) that he was as good a son of 
the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, 
said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank 
Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour 
thy father and thy mother that had the best hand 
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever 
see what I always looks back on with a loving 
heart. To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first 
entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he, 
however, had born with being the fruits of that age 
upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not 
pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full 
of extravagancies as overgrown children : the words of their 
tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice : 
their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects 
resiled from : nor were they scrupuluosly sensible of the 
proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in 
their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an 
unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that 
seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity 
born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback teethed 
and feet first into the world, which the dint of 
the surgeon’s pliers in his skill lent indeed a colour 
to, so as it put him in thought of that 
missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious 
Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle 
span of our allotted years that he had passed through 
the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary 
ascendancy and self a man of a rare forecast, he 
had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a 
rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, 
foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base 
minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable 
and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at 
the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which 
he never did hold with) to them he would concede 
neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition 
of a proper breeding : while for such that, having 
lost all forbearance can lose no more, there remained the 
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat 
a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could 
feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows 
of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever 
(as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) 
for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so
