on he was on the cards this morning when I 
laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither 
dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant 
him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides 
my face was turned the other way what was the 
7th card after that the 10 of spades for a 
Journey by laud then there was a letter on its 
way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 
of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it 
all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments

there was something about poetry in it I hope he
