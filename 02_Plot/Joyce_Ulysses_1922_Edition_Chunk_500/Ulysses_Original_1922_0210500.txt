poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation 
devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he 
was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across 
the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he 
took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. 
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea 
in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the 
coal seam of the sister island would be played out 
and if, as time went on, that turned out to 
be how the cat jumped all he could personally say 
on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, 
equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it 
was highly advisable in the interim to try to make 
the most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another 
littleinteresting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put 
it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as 
often fought for England as against her, more so, in 
fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair 
of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be 
or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, 
obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours 
with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, 
as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if 
anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as 
for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other 
person at all, he (Bloom) couldn’t help feeling, and most 
properly, it was better to give people like that the

to have anything to do with them as a golden 
rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being 
the offchance of a Dannyman coning forward and turning queen’s 
evidence — or king’s, now — like Denis or Peter 
Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that, 
he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. 
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate 
of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly 
did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what 
he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man 
who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the 
courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never 
be a party to any such thing, off the same 
bat as those love vendettas of the south — have 
her or swing for her — when the husband frequently, 
after some words passed between the two concerning her relations 
with the other lucky mortal (he man having had the 
pair watched) inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as 
a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his 
knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, 
nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators 
of the outrage and so was not, if he was
