his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with 
your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is 
a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something 
he got out of some nonsensical book that he had 
me always at myself 4 or 5 times a day 
sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O 
yes I said I am quite sure in a way 
that shut him up I knew what was coming next 
only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont 
know how the first night ever we met when I 
was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one 
another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere 
I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after 
my mother he used to amuse me the things he 
said with the half sloothering smile on him and all 
the Doyles said he was going to stand for a 
member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to 
believe all his blather about home rule and the land 
league sending me that long strool of a song out 
of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more 
classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never 
even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution 
he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he 
as a great favour the very ist opportunity he got 
a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending 
the ink got on his hands to wash it off 
with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to 
use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed 
myself sick at him that day Id better not make 
an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make 
chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit 
on it properly he kneels down to do it I 
suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the 
habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at 
the foot of the bed how can he without a 
hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might 
knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on 
his nose like that Indian god he took me to 
show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street 
all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on 
his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he 
said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our 
Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as 
hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep 
at the foot of the bed too with his big 
square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking 
thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I 
know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I 
knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time 
somewhere still she must have given him great value for
