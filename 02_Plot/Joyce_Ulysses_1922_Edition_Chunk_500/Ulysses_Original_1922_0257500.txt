relief wherever you be let your wind go free who 
knows if that pork chop I took with my cup 
of tea after was quite good with the heat I 
couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man 
in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that 
lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts 
better than having him leaving the gas on all night 
I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even 
getting up to see why am I so damned nervous 
about that though I like it in the winter its 
more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that 
winter when I was only about ten was I yes 
I had the big doll with all the funny clothes 
dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across 
from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at 
the fire with the little bit of a short shift 
I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about 
in it then make a race back into bed Im 
sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole 
time watching with the lights out in the summer and 
I in my skin hopping around I used to love 
myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only 
when it came to the chamber performance I put out 
the light too so then there were 2 of us 
Goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope 
hes not going to get in with those medicals leading 
him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 
4 in the morning it must be if not more 
still he had the manners not to wake me what 
do they find to gabber about all night squandering money 
and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then 
he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea 
Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have 
him sitting up like the king of the country pumping 
the wrong end of the spoon up and down in 
his egg wherever he learned that from and I love 
to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning 
with the cups rattling on the tray and then play 
with the cat she rubs up against you for her 
own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad 
as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate 
their claws I wonder do they see anything that we 
cant staring like that when she sits at the top 
of the stairs so long and listening as I wait 
always what a robber too that lovely fresh place I 
bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow 
or today is it Friday yes I will with some 
blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 
2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the 
London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far
