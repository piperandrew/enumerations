round and white for them always I wished I was 
one myself for a change just to try with that 
thing they have swelling upon you so hard and at 
the same time so soft when you touch it my 
uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys 
saying passing the corner of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary 
has a thing hairy because it was dark and they 
knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush 
why should it either its only nature and he puts 
his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and 
turns out to be you put the handle in a 
sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose 
what they please a married woman or a fast widow 
or a girl for their different tastes like those houses 
round behind Irish street no but were to be always 
chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up 
no damn fear once I start I tell you for 
stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over 
it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what 
they did together well naturally and if he did can 
he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and 
then he going to the other mad extreme about the 
wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even 
casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either 
its the woman he wants and he gets her what 
else were we given all those desires for Id like 
to know I cant help it if Im young still 
can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled 
hag before my time living with him so cold never 
embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end 
of me not knowing I suppose who he has any 
man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat 
at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we 
havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us 
all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before 
ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty 
brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet 
of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he 
kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody 
understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a 
woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost 
to make her look young no matter by who so 
long as to be in love or loved by somebody 
if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the 
Lord God I was thinking would I go around by 
the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me 
and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be 
hot on for it and not care a pin whose 
I was only to do it off up in a 
gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham
