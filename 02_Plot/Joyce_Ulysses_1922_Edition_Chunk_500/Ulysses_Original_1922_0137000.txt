as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled 
out : had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. 
Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he 
has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after 
him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. 
Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. 
So long as women don’t mock what matter? That’s the 
way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. 
The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by 
Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea 
per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in 
the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps 
absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be 
some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels 
the atmosphere. Old Betty’s joints are on the rack. Mother 
Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in 
the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal 
reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh. Howth. Bailey light. 
Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or 
they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace darling. People 
afraid of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists : lightingup time. 
Jewels diamonds flash better. Light is a kind of reassuring. 
Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than 
long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts 
for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. 
Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to 
spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some 
light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us 
: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star 
I see. Venus? Can’t tell yet. Two, when three it’s 
night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like 
a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical 
illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun 
setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight. Dew falling. 
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings 
on white fluxions. Never have little baby then less he 
was big strong fight his way up through. Might get 
piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on 
the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of 
the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. 
O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked. 
I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. 
Grab at all that offer. Suppose it’s the only time 
we cross legs, seated. Also the library today : those 
girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it’s the evening 
influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their 
hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the 
lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon’s garden where I kissed her 
shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her 
then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.
