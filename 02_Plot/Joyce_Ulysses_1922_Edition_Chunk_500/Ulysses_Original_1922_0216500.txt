not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell’s) was inadvertently 
knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom 
was the man who picked it up in the crush 
after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him 
(and return it to him he did with the utmost 
celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles 
away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman 
born with a stake in the country, he, as a 
matter of fact, having gone into it more for the 
kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in 
the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s 
knee in the shape of knowing what good form was 
came out at once because he turned round to the 
donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying : Thank 
you, sir though in a very different tone of voice 
from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom 
also set to rights earlier in the course of the 
day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial 
of a mutual friend when they had left him alone 
in his glory after the grim task of having committed 
his remains to the grave. On the other hand what 
incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the 
cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as 
a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why 
and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own

unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be 
a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from 
the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them 
at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in 
one another’s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and 
leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair 
one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her 
knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive 
his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would 
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears 
in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her 
fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there 
were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, 
believed, and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so 
either, that man, or men in the plural, were always 
hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even 
supposing she was the best wife in the world and 
they got on fairly well together for the sake of 
argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired 
of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter 
in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with 
improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on 
another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married 
women getting on for fair and forty and younger men,
