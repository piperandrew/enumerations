and steal our things if they could I only sent 
mine there a few times for the name model laundry 
sending me back over and over some old ones odd 
stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a

against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody 
what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk
