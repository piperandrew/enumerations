marry a lord or a gentleman with a private yacht. 
Buenas noches, señorita. El hombre ama la muchaha hermosa. Why 
me? Because you were so foreign from the others. Better 
not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather 
makes you dull. Must be getting on for nine by 
the light. Go home. Too late for Leah, Lily of 
Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital 
to see. Hope she’s over. Long day I’ve had. Martha, 
the bath, funeral, house of keys, museum with those goddesses, 
Dedalus’ song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan’s. Got my 
own back there. Drunken ranters. What I said about his 
God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. 
Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want 
to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like 
a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at 
it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not 
to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers 
for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her 
mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for 
a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of 
the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. 
Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone 
to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the 
cow. But Dignam’s put the boots on it. Houses of 
mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants 
the money. Must call to those Scottish widows as I 
promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we’re going to 
pop off first. That widow on Monday was is outside 
Cramer’s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but 
progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow’s mite. Well? What 
do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way 
along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor 
man O’Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. 
The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie 
hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face 
and a large apron. Ladies’ grey flanelette bloomers, three shillings 
a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, 
they say. Ugly : no woman thinks she is. Love, 
lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him 
sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the 
trick. U. p. : up. Fate that is. He, not 
me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog 
it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red 
slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does. Would 
I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti’s 
gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad 
of Keyes’s. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She 
has something to put in them. What’s that? Might be 
money. Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of 
paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes
