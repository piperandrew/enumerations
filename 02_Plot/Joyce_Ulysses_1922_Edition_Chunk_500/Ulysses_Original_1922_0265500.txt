naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt 
to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I 
knitted crying as I was but give it to some 
poor child but I knew well Id never have another 
our ist death too it was we were never the 
same since O Im not going to think myself into 
the glooms about that any more I wonder why he 
wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it 
was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around 
the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his 
poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining 
himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so 
silent I used to love coming home after dances the 
air of the night they have friends they can talk 
to weve none either he wants what he wont get 
or its some woman ready to stick her knife in 
you I hate that in women no wonder they treat 
us the way they do we are a dreadful lot 
of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have 
makes us so snappy Im not like that he could 
easy have slept in there on the sofa in the 
other room I suppose he was as shy as a 
boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in 
the next room hed have heard me on the chamber 
arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names 
in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names 
there father Vial plana of Santa Maria that gave me 
the rosary Rosales y O’Reilly in the Calle las Siete 
Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O 
what a name Id go and drown myself in the 
first river if I had a name like her O 
my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and 
Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the 
devils gap steps well small blame to me if I 
am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I 
declare to God I dont feel a day older than 
then I wonder could I get my tongue round any 
of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y 
usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I 
had only for the grammar a noun is the name 
of any person place or thing pity I never tried 
to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by 
Valera with the questions in it all upside down the 
two ways I always knew wed go away in the 
end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell 
me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant 
what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor 
fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly 
I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed 
with a bit of toast so long as I didnt
