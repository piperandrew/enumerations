on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing 
any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in 
Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for 
the one thing he slept on the floor half the 
night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies 
belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak 
a word wanting to be petted so I thought I 
stood out enough for one time and let him he 
does it all wrong too thinking only of his own 
pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know 
what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him 
do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock 
him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles

dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any

wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping 
that barmaid he does of course his wife is always 
sick or going to be sick or just getting better 
of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes 
getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice 
lot all of them well theyre not going to get 
my husband again into their clutches if I can help 
it making fun of him then behind his back I 
know well when he goes on with his idiotics because
