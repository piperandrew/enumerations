out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord 
how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a 
wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume 
it in the morning dont forget I bet he never 
saw a better pair of thighs than that look how 
white they are the smoothest place is right there between 
this bit here how soft like a peach easy God 
I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on 
a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making 
like the jersey lily easy O how the waters come 
down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter
