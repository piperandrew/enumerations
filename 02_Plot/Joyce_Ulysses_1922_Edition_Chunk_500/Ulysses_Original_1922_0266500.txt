theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet 
I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought 
to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my 
belly unless I made him stand there and put him 
into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap 
and make him do it in front of me serve 
him right its all his own fault if I am 
an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O 
much about it if thats all the harm ever we 
did in this vale of tears God knows its not 
much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats 
what a woman is supposed to be there for or 
He wouldn’t have made us the way He did so 
attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my 
bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right 
out in his face as large as life he can 
stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes 
there my brown part then Ill tell him I want 
£ 1 or perhaps 30/ Ill tell him I want 
to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well 
he wont be too bad I dont want to soak 
it all out of him like other women do I 
could often have written out a fine cheque for myself 
and write his name on it for a couple of 
pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up 
besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it 
off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my 
good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill 
do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by 
the answers when hes like that he cant keep a 
thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten 
my bottom well and let out a few smutty words 
smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing 
comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O 
wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite 
gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting 
this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know 
which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of 
plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old 
things so much the better itll be more pointed hell 
never know whether he did it nor not there thats 
good enough for you any old thing at all then 
Ill wipe him off me just like a business his 
omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up 
at the ceiling where is she gone now make him 
want me thats the only way a quarter after what 
an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in 
China now combing out their pigtails for the day well 
soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming 
in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or
