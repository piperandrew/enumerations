`` But that would do me no good , '' said Rosamond , `` for here is Caroline , with superior claims of every sort , and with that most undisputed of all the rights of woman -- beauty . '' 
`` True -- but Caroline would never accept of stray hearts , '' said Godfrey . 
`` See how her lip curls with pride at the bare imagination ! '' 
`` Pride never curled Caroline 's lip , '' cried Rosamond -- `` Besides , pride is very becoming to a woman . 
`` Before you fly off , Rosamond , to my mother , as to an ally , whom you are sure I can not resist , '' said Godfrey , `` settle first , whether you mean to defend Caroline upon the ground of her having or not having pride . '' 
-- Her sister , Caroline , followed , and they looked out in silence . 
`` I see a light to the left of the beacon , '' said Caroline . 
-- `` Minute guns '' -- said Caroline . 
The Percy family , nearly as much fatigued as their guests , were also glad to rest -- all but Rosamond , who was wide awake , and so much excited by what had happened , that she continued talking to her sister , who slept in the same room with her , of every circumstance , and telling her imaginations of all that might come to pass from the adventures of the night , whilst Caroline , too sleepy to be able to answer judiciously , or even plausibly , said , `` yes '' -- `` no '' -- and `` very true '' -- in the wrong place , and at length , incapable of uttering even a monosyllable , was reduced to inarticulate sounds in sign of attention . 
These grew fainter and fainter , and after long intervals absolutely failing , Rosamond with some surprise and indignation exclaimed -- `` I do believe , Caroline , you are asleep ! '' 
`` I will consider of it , ma'am , '' said Rosamond , `` in the meantime , Caroline , you will allow , that M. de Tourville is very agreeable ? '' 
repeated Caroline -- such a selfish being ! 
`` You mean he was himself '' -- said Caroline . 
`` You are very ungrateful , Caroline , '' cried Rosamond , `` for I am sure M. de Tourville admires you extremely -- yes , in spite of that provoking incredulous smile , I say he does admire you exceedingly . '' 
`` And if he did , '' replied Caroline , `` that would make no difference in my opinion of him . '' 
Presently , taking a seat between Rosamond and Caroline , he applied himself to draw out their talents for conversation . 
-- M. de Tourville , as Rosamond had justly observed , seemed to be particularly struck with Miss Caroline Percy . 
-- She was beautiful , and of an uncommon style of beauty . 
Ingenuous , unaffected , and with all the simplicity of youth , there was a certain dignity and graceful self-possession in her manner , which gave the idea of a superior character . 
She had , perhaps , less of what the French call esprit , than M. de Tourville had been accustomed to meet with in young persons on the Continent , but he was the more surprised by the strength and justness of thought which appeared in her plain replies to the finesse of some of his questions . 
The morning of the second day that he was at Percy Hall , M. de Tourville was admiring the Miss Percys ' drawings , especially some miniatures of Caroline 's , and he produced his snuff-box , to show Mr. Percy a beautiful miniature on it 's lid . 
M. de Tourville offered it to Caroline to copy , and Mrs. Percy urged her to make the attempt . 
Mr. Percy , repeated the anecdotes to Mrs. Percy and his daughters ; and M. de Tourville , as soon as he saw that the ladies , and especially Caroline , differed from him , immediately endeavoured to slide round to their opinion , and assured Caroline , with many asseverations , and with his hand upon his heart , that he had merely been speaking of the light in which these things appeared to the generality of men of the world , that for his own particular feelings they were all in favour of the frankness and generosity of character , evinced by these imprudences -- he only lamented that certain qualities should expose their possessor to the censure and ridicule of those , who were , like half the world , incapable of being moved by any motive but interest , and unable to reach to the idea of the moral sublime . '' 
The more M. de Tourville said upon the subject , and the more gesture and emphasis he used to impress the belief in his truth , the less Caroline believed him , and the more dislike and contempt she felt , for the duplicity and pitiful meanness of a character , which was always endeavouring to seem , instead of to be . 
-- He understood and felt the expression of her countenance , and mortified by that dignified silence , which said more than words could express , he turned away , and never afterwards addressed to her any of his confidential conversation . 
She wished , as she told Caroline , that some one would write `` Advice to Diplomatists , '' in the manner of Swift 's Advice to Servants ; and she observed that M. de Tourville , chargèd ' affaires , & c. , might supply anecdotes illustrative , and might embellish the work with a portrait of a finished diplomatist . 
He was too little of a soldier for Godfrey 's taste , too much of a courtier for Mr. Percy -- too frivolous for Caroline , and too little romantic for Rosamond . 
-- Then I could marry , by Jove ; and I 'd propose directly for Caroline Percy , for I 'm confoundedly in love with her -- such a sweet-tempered good creature ! 
-- Such a fashionable looking figure too -- though she has not come out yet -- dances charmingly -- would dance divinely , if she would let herself out -- and she sings and plays like an angel , fifty times better than our two precious sisters , who have been at it from their cradles , with all the Signor Squalicis at their elbows -- Caroline Percy never exhibits in public . 
-- `` But as I was saying of my dear Caroline ... My Caroline ! 
-- She is not mine yet . '' 
`` But nothing is so provoking as always agreeing with one -- and I can tell you , Mr. Verytrue , that though Caroline Percy is not mine yet , I have nevertheless a little suspicion , that , such even as I am , she might readily be brought to love , honor , and obey me . '' 
-- `` There you are wrong , John , on the other side , '' said Buckhurst -- `` for I can assure you , Miss Caroline Percy is not one of your young ladies who would marry any body . 
And even though she might like me , I am not at all sure that she would marry me -- for obedience to the best of fathers might interfere . '' 
Left to his own cogitations , Buckhurst fell into a reverie upon the charms of Caroline Percy , and upon the probable pleasure of dancing with her at the race-ball ; after this , he recurred to the bitter recollection , that he must decide about his debts , and the church . 
This Buckhurst faithfully promised to do , and only implored permission to declare his attachment to Caroline . 
-- Caroline was at this time not quite eighteen , too young , her father said , to think of forming any serious engagement , even were it with a person suited to her in fortune and in every other respect . 
-- Buckhurst declared , that he had no idea of endeavoring , even to obtain from Miss Caroline Percy , any promise or engagement . 
-- He had been treated , he said , too generously by her father , to attempt to take any step without his entire approbation . 
Mr. Percy thought it was more prudent to let it be declared openly than to have it secretly suspected , therefore he consented to this request , trusting much to Buckhurst 's honor and to Caroline 's prudence . 
-- Even at this early age she had raised in the minds of those who knew her best a confidence in her judgment and discretion . 
To this first declaration of love Caroline listened with a degree of composure , which astonished and mortified her lover . 
He had flattered himself that , at least , her vanity or pride would have been apparently gratified by her conquest . 
-- But there was none of the flutter of vanity in her manner , nor any of the repressed satisfaction of pride . 
There was in her looks and words only simplicity and dignity . 
-- She began by assuring Buckhurst , that she knew nothing of love , and that she wished , whilst she was still so young , to keep her affections disengaged . 
She said , that she was at present occupied happily in various ways , endeavoring to improve herself , and that she should be sorry to have her mind turned from these pursuits ; she desired to secure time to compare and judge of her own tastes , and of the characters of others , before she should make any engagement , or form an attachment on which the happiness of her life must depend . 
She said , she was equally desirous to keep herself free , and to avoid injuring the happiness of the man who had honored her by his preference : therefore she requested he would discontinue a pursuit , which she could not encourage him to hope would ever be successful . 
-- Long before the time when she should think it prudent to marry , even if she were to meet with a character perfectly suited to hers , she hoped that her cousin , Buckhurst , would be united to some woman who would be able to return his affection . 
The manner in which all this was said convinced Buckhurst , that she spoke the plain and exact truth . 
From the ease and frankness with which she had hitherto conversed with him , he had flattered himself , that it would not be difficult to prepossess her heart in his favor ; but now , when he saw the same ease and simplicity unchanged in her manner , he was convinced that he had been mistaken . 
-- He had still hopes that in time he might make an impression upon her , and he urged that she was not yet sufficiently acquainted with his character to be able to judge whether or not it would suit hers . 
She frankly told him all she thought of him , and in doing so impressed him with the conviction , that she had both discerned the merits and discovered the defects of his character : she gave him back a representation of himself , which he felt to be exactly just , and yet which struck him with all the force of novelty . 
He had such pleasure in hearing Caroline speak of him , that he wished even to hear her speak of his faults -- of these he would , however , have been better pleased , if she had spoken with less calmness and indulgence . 
-- The novelty of this insensibility , and of this perfect simplicity , so unlike all he had observed in the manners and minds of other young ladies to whom he had been accustomed , had , however , a great effect upon her lover . 
The openness and unaffected serenity of Caroline 's countenance at this moment appeared to him more charming , than any other thing he had ever beheld in the most finished coquet , or the most fashionable beauty . 
What a divine creature she will be a few years hence ! 
-- With these mixed ideas of love and glory , Buckhurst took leave of Caroline ; still he retained hope in spite of her calm and decided refusal . 
His head was intent on a ball and on Caroline , -- However he was obliged to undergo this labor , and when he had finished it , Mr. Percy , who happened to be preparing some new leases of considerable farms , was so busy , in the midst of his papers , that there was no such thing as touching upon the subject of the ball . 
-- exclaimed Buckhurst , turning suddenly towards Caroline , `` Do you imagine that is my object ? '' 
-- then approaching her , he said in a low voice , `` It is a natural mistake for you to make , Miss Caroline Percy -- for you -- who know nothing of love . 
`` Then I will not go , '' said Caroline , -- `` It would be coquetry to meet you there , when , as I thought , I had distinctly explained to you yesterday -- '' `` Oh ! 
`` I never will give any false hopes , '' said Caroline , `` and since I can not add to your happiness , I will take care not to diminish it . 
Buckhurst smiled , went on with some common-place raillery about cruelty , and took his leave , fancying that Caroline could not be in earnest in her threat , as he called it . 
When the time came he went to the ball , almost certain that Caroline would break her resolution , as he knew that she had never yet been at a public assembly , and it was natural that one so sure of being admired would be anxious to be seen . 
-- His surprise and disappointment were great when no Caroline appeared . 
He asked Rosamond if her sister was not well ? 
`` How little you know of Caroline , '' replied Rosamond , `` if you imagine that either in trifles , or in matters of consequence , she would say one thing and do another . '' 
`` I feel , '' said Buckhurst , coloring , `` what that emphasis on she means . 
`` Surely it is no great crime in a young man to like going to a ball better than going to the Temple -- But I am really concerned , '' continued Buckhurst , `` that I have deprived Miss Caroline Percy of the pleasure of being here to night . 
... And this was to have been her first appearance in public . 
`` Caroline is not at all impatient to appear in public ; and as to the pleasure of being at a ball it costs her little to sacrifice that , or any pleasure of her own , for the advantage of others . '' 
`` When Miss Caroline Percy said something about my falling in her father 's opinion for such a trifle , I could not guess that she was serious . '' 
`` She does not , '' replied Rosamond , `` think it a trifle to break a promise . '' 
I wish I had gone yesterday -- Pray , my dear , good Rosamond , say so for me to Caroline '' -- At this moment a beautiful young lady , attended by a large party , entered the ball-room -- Buckhurst stopped to inquire who she was . 
replied Colonel Hauton , -- `` Oh I must introduce you , and you shall dance with her . '' 
`` For instance , '' said Rosamond , `` my sister Caroline is just the kind of woman , who , if she had been one of these unfortunate daughters , would have made herself an exception . '' 
`` Very likely , '' said Mr. Percy , laughing , `` but why you should go so far out of your way to make an unfortunate daughter of poor Caroline , and why you should picture to yourself , as Dr. Johnson would say , what would be probable in an impossible situation , I can not conceive , except for the pleasure of exercising , as you do upon most occasions , a fine romantic imagination . '' 
-- Buckhurst Falconer , whom she alternately blamed and pitied , accused and defended -- Sometimes rejoicing that Caroline had rejected his suit , sometimes pitying him for his disappointment , and repeating that with such talents , frankness , and generosity of disposition , it was much to be regretted that he had not that rectitude of principle , and steadiness of character , which alone could render him worthy of Caroline . 
Then passing from compassion for the son , to indignation against the father , she observed , `` that Commissioner Falconer seemed determined to counteract all that was good in his son 's disposition , that he actually did every thing in his power , to encourage Buckhurst in a taste for dissipation as it seemed , on purpose to keep him in a state of dependance , and to enslave him to the great . '' 
... He has another sister , I think , some one told me , a beautiful sister Caroline , who was not at the ball last night ? '' 
-- `` Is Miss Caroline Percy like her mother ? '' 
-- `` Like her father -- or her brother ? '' 
His last words , as he got upon his horse , were to Caroline . 
`` Caroline , you will be married before I return . '' 
When he said something of this sort , before his servants , who were all assembled , it was observed that one of them , a very old nurse , looked immediately at Caroline , then lifted up her hands and eyes to Heaven , in silent gratitude . 
Caroline , however , recollected her , and ran to her room , which was in the attic story over the library . 
When Caroline opened the door , she could scarcely see the bed . 
-- She made her way to it , however , got old Martha out of the room , and with great difficulty brought the bewildered , decrepit creature , safely down a small stair-case , which the flames had not then reached . 
-- Nothing could exceed her gratitude ; with eyes streaming with tears , and a head shaking with strong emotion , she delighted in relating all these circumstances , and declared , that none but Miss Caroline could have persuaded her to go down that staircase , when she saw all below in flames . 
-- Old Martha , whose life Caroline had saved , had a son , who possessed some talents as a painter , and who had learnt the art of painting on glass . 
-- He chose for his subject the fire , and the moment when Caroline was assisting his decrepit mother down the dangerous staircase . 
-- The painting was finished and put up on Caroline 's birth-day , when she had just attained her eighteenth year . 
I was , -LRB- I assure you -RRB- prudently silent , till he pressed for my opinion , and then , I could not avoid confessing , that I suspected it to be a made shell -- made , Caroline knows how , by the application of acids . 
Thank Caroline for her cordial letter Your affectionate son , E. Percy . '' 
-- Thank Caroline for observing the advertisement of the sale of law books . 
The public attention he showed her was , in my opinion , designed only to pique Caroline , whom , I 'm persuaded , he thinks -- -LRB- between the fits of half a dozen other fancies -RRB- the first of women , -- as he always calls her . 
-- He has many good points in his disposition , but Caroline had penetration enough to see , that his character would never suit hers ; and I rejoice , that she gave him a decided refusal . 
Bid her remember I have acknowledged that he has talents and generosity : but that which interests Rosamond in his favor inclines ill-natured me against him -- his being one of Caroline 's suitors . 
Thank Caroline for her letter -- and assure Rosamond , that , though I have never noticed it , I was grateful for her entertaining account of M. de Tourville 's vis . 
Soon after this letter had been received , and while the picture of his life and the portraits of his worthy companions were yet fresh in her view , Buckhurst Falconer took the unhappy moment to write to renew his declaration of passionate attachment to Caroline , and to beg to be permitted to wait upon her once more . 
From the indignant blush , which mounted in Caroline 's face on reading his letter , Rosamond saw how unlikely it was , that this request should be granted . 
-- Rosamond could not refrain from a few words of apology , and looks of commiseration for Buckhurst ; yet she entirely approved of Caroline 's answer to his letter , and the steady repetition of her refusal , and even of the strengthened terms in which it was now expressed . 
`` You have decided prudently , my dear Caroline , I acknowledge , '' said she , `` But now your letter is fairly gone ; now that it is all over , and that we are safe , I begin to think you are a little too prudent for your age . 
-- Bless me , Caroline , if you are so prudent at eighteen , what will you be at thirty ? 
`` Caroline , my dear , '' continued she , `` you shall not be my heroine -- you are too well proportioned for a heroine ; in mind , I mean -- a heroine may , must have a finely proportioned person , but never a well-proportioned mind . 
-- So , my dear Caroline , I am content , that you are my sister and my friend , though I give you up as a heroine . '' 
-- `` Tell dear Caroline the portfolio she made for me shall go with me to the world 's end ; and Rosamond 's Tippoo Saib shall see the West Indies -- Gascoigne has been in the West Indies before now , and he says and proves , that temperance and spice are the best preservatives in that climate ; so you need not fear for me , for you know I love pepper better than port . 
`` P. S. Do n't let my mother or Rosamond trust to newspaper reports -- Trust to nothing but my letters -- Caroline , I know , is fit to be the sister , and I hope will some time be the mother of heroes . '' 
-- I intended it for Caroline , but forgot to say so in the hurry of our departure . 
-- Do you settle with De Berg for me handsomely , and send the horse down to Caroline , with my love , hoping White-Surrey will prove both gentle and spirited . 
Write me long letters and full accounts of yourselves -- Rosamond and Caroline promise to furnish me with a home-journal regularly . 
-- And there 's Miss Caroline Percy , who has declined the honor of my hand , no doubt , merely because I have indulged a little in good company , instead of immuring myself with Coke and Black-stone , Viners and Saunders , Bosanquet and Schoales , or chaining myself to a special-pleader 's desk , like cousin Alfred , that galley-slave of the law ! 
Buckhurst 's resentment against Caroline for her repeated refusals suddenly subsided , his attachment revived with redoubled force . 
He protested , that he loved her the better for having lost her fortune , and he reiterated this protestation more loudly , because his father declared it was absurd and ridiculous . 
Buckhurst immediately wrote to Caroline , a passionate declaration of the constancy and ardor of his attachment , and entreated her permission to wait upon her immediately . 
-- Caroline , do not sacrifice me to idle niceties -- I know I have the misfortune not to please your brother Alfred -- to do him justice , he has fairly told me that he does not think me worthy of his sister Caroline -- I forgive him , I admire him for the pride with which he pronounces the words , my sister Caroline -- But though she may easily find a more faultless character , she will never find a warmer heart , or one more truly , more ardently attached . '' 
-- Indeed the great merit of being ardently attached to her sister Caroline was sufficient , in Rosamond 's eyes , to cover a multitude of sins ; and the contrast between his warmth at this moment , and the coldness of the rest of his family , struck her foreibly . 
`` But love has not cured him of any yet , '' said Caroline . 
Caroline shook her head , -- `` Consider at what expense that trial must be made . '' 
-- At the first reading of Buckhurst 's letter , Caroline had been pleased with it ; but on a second perusal , she was dissatisfied with the passage about his parents , nor could she approve of his giving up what he now called his scruples , to obtain a competence for the woman he professed to adore . 
He had some right feeling , but no steady principle , as Caroline observed . 
She was grateful for the constancy of his attachment , and for the generosity he showed in his whole conduct towards her , nor was she insensible to the urgency with which Rosamond pleaded in his favor ; but she was firm in her own judgment , and her refusal , though expressed in the terms that could best soften the pain it must give , was as decided as possible . 
At last Caroline , who had climbed upon a high bank in the lane where they were walking , saw a smoke rising between some trees at a little distance ; and toward this spot they made their way through another lane , the entrance to which had been stopped up with furze bushes . 
As soon as she had set the chairs , she was retiring to an inner room , but her child , who was pleased with Caroline 's face as she smiled and nodded at him , stretched out his little hands towards her . 
The child patted Caroline 's cheek , played with her hair , and laughed aloud . 
-- Caroline offered to take the child in her arms , but the mother held him fast , and escaped into the inner room , where they heard her sobbing violently . 
-- Caroline and Rosamond looked at one another in silence , and left the cottage by tacit consent , sorry that they had given pain , and feeling that they had no right to intrude farther . 
-- `` We can go home the same way that we came , '' said Caroline , `` and that is better than to trouble any body . '' 
dear ladies , '' said she , looking up at Rosamond and Caroline , `` I see you have kind hearts within you , and I thank you for pitying poor Kate . '' 
`` I wish we could do any thing to serve her , '' said Caroline . 
-- The good woman paused and looked , as if she expected to be questioned . 
-- Caroline was silent , and the old woman looked disappointed . 
repeated Caroline , indignantly . 
`` I am not a great lady , '' said Caroline . 
-- As they were now within sight of their own house , they thanked and dismissed their loquacious , but kind-hearted guide , putting into her hand some money for poor Kate , Caroline promising to make further inquiries -- Rosamond , without restriction , promising all manner of assistance pecuniary , medical , and spiritual . 
The result of the inquiries that were made confirmed the truth of all that old Dorothy had related , and brought to light other circumstances relative to the seduction and desertion of this poor girl , which so shocked Rosamond , that in proportion to her former prepossession in Buckhurst 's favor was now her abhorrence ; and as if to repair the imprudence with which she had formerly used her influence over her sister 's mind in his favor , she now went as far on the opposite side , abjuring him with the strongest expressions of indignation , and wishing that Caroline 's last letter had not gone to Buckhurst , that she might have given her refusal on this special account , in the most severe and indignant terms the English language could supply . 
Mrs. Percy , however , on the contrary , rejoiced that Caroline 's letter had been sent , before they knew any thing of this affair . 
`` But , Ma'am , '' cried Rosamond , -- `` surely it would have been right for Caroline to have given this reason for her refusal , and to have declared , that this had proved to her beyond a possibility of doubt , that her former objections to Mr. Buckhurst Falconer 's principles were too well founded -- and it would have become Caroline to have written with strong indignation . 
-- And Caroline , who has beauty and eloquence , can do this with effect . 
-- I remember Godfrey once said , that the peculiar characteristic of Caroline , that in which she differed most from the common herd of young ladies , is in her power of feeling and expressing virtuous indignation . 
I am sure that Godfrey , partial as he is to Mr. Buckhurst Falconer , would think that Caroline ought , on such an occasion , to set an example of that proper spirit , which , superior to the fear of ridicule and fashion , dares to speak the indignation it feels . '' 
-- If , like your sister Caroline , young ladies would show , that they really do not prefer such men , it would do essential service . 
Had Caroline in her letter expressed her indignation in the most severe terms that the English language could supply , she would only have exposed herself to the ridicule of Mr. Buckhurst Falconer 's fashionable companions , as a prating , preaching prude , without doing the least good to him , or to any one living . '' 
Rosamond reluctantly acknowledged that `` perhaps her mother was right . '' 
`` But , Caroline , how quietly you sit by , while we are talking of you and your lover , '' cried Rosamond ; `` I do not know whether to be provoked with you , or to admire you . '' 
-- `` Admire me , pray , '' said Caroline , `` if you can . '' 
said Caroline , coloring deeply -- and with a look and tone that expressed her keen sense of injustice . 
Rosamond , '' continued Caroline , whose mind was now too highly wrought for raillery -- `` Is love to be trifled with ? 
-- Caroline paused , and Rosamond , for some instants , looked at her and at her mother in silence ; then exclaimed -- `` All this from Caroline ! 
`` No , '' said Mrs. Percy , `` I was aware that this was in Caroline 's mind . '' 
`` I was not '' -- said Rosamond , `` She who never spoke of love ! 
-- I little imagined that she thought of it so highly , so seriously . '' 
cried Caroline , looking fervently upwards as she spoke with an illuminated countenance . 
continued Caroline , turning eagerly , and seizing her mother 's hand -- `` My guide , my guardian , whenever you see in me any , the slightest inclination , to coquetry , warn me ... as you wish to save me from that which I should most dread , the reproaches of my own conscience ... in the first , the very first instance , reprove me , mother , if you can ... with severity . 
-- Her mother , into whose arms she threw herself , pressed Caroline close to her heart , while Rosamond , to whom she had given her hand , held it fast and stood motionless between surprise and sympathy . 
-- Caroline , to whose usual manners and disposition every thing theatrical or romantic was so foreign , seemed , as soon as she recollected herself , to be ashamed of the excessive emotion and enthusiasm she had shown ; withdrawing her hand from her sister , she turned away , and left the room . 
Her mother and sister both remained silent for a considerable time , fully occupied with their own thoughts and feelings . 
The mother 's reverie looked to the future prospects of her daughter ; -- confident in Caroline 's character , yet uncertain of her fate , she felt a pleasing yet painful solicitude . 
Rosamond 's thoughts turned rather to the past than to the future ; she recollected and compared words and looks , yet found insuperable difficulty in connecting all she had ever before known or fancied of Caroline , with what she had just seen and heard . 
She then went in search of Caroline , in hopes of renewing the conversation ; but she found her busied in some of the common affairs of life , and apparently a different person . 
Rosamond , though she made divers attempts , could not lead Caroline back again to the same train of thought , or tone of expression . 
-- Caroline , intent upon the means of assisting the poor young woman whom they had seen at the cottage , went there again as soon as she could , to warn old Dorothy , in the first place , to be less communicative , and not on any account to mention to any one else the names and circumstances which she had told them with so little reserve . 
Caroline next applied to Dr. Leicester , the vicar of their former parish , a most amiable and respectable clergyman , who had come from his vicarage , near Percy-Hall , to spend what time he could spare from his duties with his favorite parishioners ; at Caroline 's request he willingly went to see this unhappy young woman , endeavored , and succeeded in his endeavors , to sooth and tranquillize her mind by speaking to her words of peace . 
His mild piety raised and comforted the trembling penitent ; and while all prospect of forgiveness from her parents , or of happiness in this world , was at an end , he fixed her thoughts on those better hopes and promises , which religion only can afford . 
Her health appeared suddenly to mend when her mind was more at ease : but this was only transient , and Dr. Erasmus Percy , to whom Caroline applied for his medical opinion , gave little hopes of her recovery . 
-- All that could be done by medicine , and proper kindness , to assuage her sufferings during her decline , was done in the best manner by Mrs. Percy and her daughters -- especially by Caroline . 
-- The young woman , nevertheless , died in six weeks -- and was buried without Buckhurst Falconer 's making any inquiry concerning her -- probably without his knowing of her death . 
-- A few days after she was no more , a letter came to her , from him , which was returned unopened by Dorothy , who could just write well enough to make these words intelligible in the cover . 
-- Upon their first coming out , you should ... '' Here her Ladyship stopped short , for Caroline and Rosamond returned -- `` Oh ! 
And there are some people who can throw this radiance where and on whom they please ; -- just as easily , '' said Lady Jane ; playing with a spoon she held in her hand , `` just as easily , as I throw the sunshine , now upon this object , and now upon that , now upon Caroline , and now upon Rosamond . 
-- And observe , no eye turns upon the beauteous Caroline now , because she is left in the shade . '' 
She has a vast deal of address , -- And for a proof , as I was going to point out to you , there are the Miss Falconers in the first circles , -- asked every where -- yet without fortunes , and with no pretensions beyond , or equal to , what your daughters have , -- not with half Rosamond 's wit and information -- nothing comparable in point of beauty and accomplishments to Caroline ; yet how they have got on ! 
-- See what fashion can do ... Come , come , we must court her patronage -- Leave that to me ... I assure you I understand the ways and means . '' 
`` But if such a thing should offer , I presume you would not wish , that Rosamond or Caroline should refuse . '' 
But I flatter myself , if you will trust me with your daughter Caroline , we should manage matters rather better . 
-- Now let me tell you my plan -- My plan is to take Caroline with me immediately to Tunbridge , previous to her London campaign . 
-- But I could not bear the thoughts of your sweet pretty Caroline 's blushing unseen . '' 
`` Nor could we , '' said Mr. Percy , `` bear the thoughts of her ceasing to blush from being too much seen . 
-- I will have Caroline with me to Tunbridge , and to town , in spite of their wise heads . '' 
Caroline , my dear , '' said she , turning to Caroline , who was at the farthest end of the room -- `` Do n't look so unconscious , for you are a party concerned ; so come , and kneel at the feet of this perverse father of yours , to plead your cause and mine , I must take you with me to Tunbridge . 
Come , you must let me have her a summer and winter , and I will answer for Caroline 's success . '' 
said Caroline . 
repeated Mrs. Percy , in a scornful tone , `` but neither Caroline nor I should be satisfied , unless she be very well married . '' 
I did not understand the exact meaning of very well married ... did you Caroline ? 
`` Let me advise you , '' said Lady Jane , in her very gravest tone , `` not to puff up Caroline 's imagination with a parcel of romantic notions . 
said Caroline -- `` as happy as we are now ? '' 
-- May I hope , Mr. and Mrs. Percy , to have the pleasure of Caroline 's company at Tunbridge next week , and in Town next winter , or not ? 
-- `` That is a question which your Ladyship will be so good as to ask Caroline , if you please , '' said Mr. Percy ; `` both her mother and I wish , that she should decide for herself . '' 
-- cried Lady Jane -- `` Then , my dear Caroline , if you please , come with me this minute to my dressing-room , and we 'll settle it all at my toilette de nuit . 
I have a notion , '' added her Ladyship , `` as she drew Caroline 's arm within hers , and led her out of the room , I have a notion , that I shall not find you quite so impracticable as your father has shown himself . '' 
`` You may leave us , Keppel , '' -- said Lady Jane , `` to her maid , as she went into her dressing-room , I will ring when I want you . 
-- My love , '' said she to Caroline , who stood beside her dressing-table , `` why did not you let Keppel dress your hair to day ? 
Caroline colored at this speech . 
`` No , '' -- said Caroline , smiling , `` but what is much better , he is a man to be convinced . '' 
said Caroline , `` the arts of persuasion might be turned against us by others , but the power of conviction never could . '' 
exclaimed Caroline . 
`` Nor would I , '' said Caroline . 
he does not feel it , ma'am -- I assure you , '' -- said Caroline , with emotion . 
`` Indeed , ma'am , '' said Caroline , `` if I am his favorite , I do not know it . '' 
You must be a favorite with every body -- and yet , '' said Lady Jane -- and she paused . 
`` I would if I knew , '' -- said Caroline . 
said Caroline , smiling . 
What was Lady Jane Granville 's astonishment , when she heard Caroline decline , with polite thanks , her kind invitation . 
Her Ladyship stood silent with suspended indignation . 
`` I believe my father and mother do not think so , '' said Caroline , `` and till they do , I wish to stay with them , and share their fortune , whatever it may be . '' 
`` I have done -- as you please -- you are to decide for yourself , Miss Caroline Percy -- This is your final determination ? '' 
`` It is , '' said Caroline -- `` but permit me , '' added she , taking Lady Jane 's hand , and endeavoring by the kindest tone of gratitude , to avert the displeasure which she saw gathering -- `` Permit me to assure you , that I am truly grateful for your kindness , and I hope ... I am sure , that I never shall forget it . '' 
Lady Jane drew away her hand haughtily -- `` Permit me to assure you , Miss Caroline Percy , that there are few , very few young ladies indeed , even among my own nearest relations , to whom I would have undertaken to be chaperon . 
Caroline retired , sorry to have displeased one who had shown so much friendly eagerness to serve her , yet not in the least disposed to change her determination . 
-- But before we go to Hungerford-Castle , and before we see Colonel Hungerford -- upon whom , doubtless , many a one at this instant , as well as Rosamond Percy , has formed designs or prognostics in favor of Caroline ... we must read the following letter , aud bring up the affairs of Alfred and Erasmus . 
-- I agree with you in rejoicing , that Caroline had sufficient penetration to see the faults of Buckhurst Falconer 's character , and steadiness enough , notwithstanding his agreeable talents , never to give him any encouragement . 
I agree with you also , that it was fortunate that her last letter to him was written and sent , before this affair came to her knowledge . 
It was much better that she should abide by her objection to his general principles , than to have had explanations and discussions on a subject , into which she could not enter with propriety . 
Buckhurst had , I believe , hopes that Caroline would have relented , in consequence of his last overture ; he was thrown into despair by her answer , containing , as he told me , such a calm and civil repetition of her refusal -- that he swears he will never trouble her again . 
-- Love to Caroline , and thanks for her letter . 
Quick as eye could glance , her Ladyship 's passed by Mrs. Percy and Rosamond as they entered the room , fixed upon Caroline , and was satisfied . 
-- Caroline entered , without any prepared grace or practised smile , but merely as if she was coming into a room . 
-- Her two friends , the Lady Pembrokes , instantly placed her between them , her countenance expressing just what she felt , affectionate pleasure at seeing them . 
-- Mr. Barclay 's eye followed , and fixed upon Caroline with a degree of interest . 
-- The room was so large , and they were at such a distance from Caroline , who was now occupied in listening to her friends , that Lady Angelica could continue her observations without fear of being overheard . 
`` That is a pity , '' said Mr. Barclay , withdrawing his eyes from Miss Caroline Percy . 
-- `` So , '' thought Rosamond , `` we shall be gone before he comes , and he will not see Caroline ! '' 
-- Rosamond was somewhat comforted for her disappointment , by observing , that Caroline was not quite lost upon Mr. Barclay , preoccupied though he was with his brilliant mistress . 
-- She thought he seemed to notice the marked difference there was in their manner of passing the day . 
-- Caroline was continually occupied . 
In the morning , Caroline usually sat with Rosamond and the two Lady Pembrokes , in a little room called the Oriel , which opened into the great library . 
Here in happy retirement Caroline and Rosamond looked over Mrs. Hungerford 's select library , and delighted to read the passages , which Mrs. Hungerford had marked with approbation . 
At other times , without disturbing the rest of the company , or being disturbed by them , Caroline enjoyed the opportunity of cultivating her talents for music and painting , with the assistance of her two friends , who eminently excelled in these accomplishments . 
-- The beauties of nature have come into fashion of late , and Lady Angelica Headingham could talk of bold outlines , and sublime mountains , the charming effects of light and shade , fine accidents , and rich foliage -- spring verdure and autumnal tints , -- whilst Caroline could enjoy all these things , without expecting to be admired for admiring them . 
Caroline took an unaffected interest in all her plans ; -- whilst Lady Angelica was interested only in showing how much she remembered of Price , and Repton , and Knight . 
-- With these hopes he performed his daily , hourly duty of admiration to his fair patroness , with all possible zeal and assiduity -- but it was observed by Rosamond , that , in conversation , whenever Mr. Seebright had a new idea or a favorite allusion to produce , his eye involuntarily turned , first to Caroline ; and though he professed , on all points of taste and criticism , to be implicitly governed by Lady Angelica Headingham , there was `` a small still voice , to which he more anxiously listened . '' 
`` She should be so happy to introduce him to this great man , or to mention him to that great lady -- She should be so proud , on her return to town , to have Mr. Grey at her esprit parties -- She would have such and such celebrated characters to meet him , and would have the pleasure and honor of introducing him to every person worth knowing in town . '' 
With all her resources , however , both of patronage and of bel-esprit , Lady Angelica was equally surprised and mortified , to find herself foiled at her own arms by a girl whom nobody knew -- She changed her manoeuvres -- she thought she could show Miss Caroline Percy , that , whatever might be her abilities , her knowledge , or her charms , these must all submit to a superior power -- the power of fashion . 
Caroline having lived in the country , could not know much of the world of fashion . 
-- This was a world from which she thought she could move every other at pleasure . 
Her conversation was no longer of books , of which all of equal talents were competent to form a judgment ; but her talk was now of persons , with whom no one , who had not lived in the great world , could pretend to be acquainted , much less could presume to judge . 
Her Ladyship tried in vain to draw Mrs. Hungerford and Mrs. Mortimer to her aid ; they were too well-bred , to encourage this exclusive and unprofitable conversation . 
-- But though their combined operations were carried on with consummate skill , and though the league offensive was strictly kept with every demonstration of mutual amity that could excite jealousy , or express contempt for rival powers ; yet the ultimate purpose was not gained -- Caroline was not mortified , and Mr. Barclay was not jealous . 
-- As to Caroline , in vain her Ladyship blazoned forth her fashionable titles to distinction ; Caroline was not amazed at the Right Honorable array that was mustered before her . 
She was absolutely content , without being able to tell who were , or were not , to be married this year , or who had been , or who were to be divorced . 
She could even employ herself , or be amused with her own thoughts , just as well and as happily whilst all this fashionable technical tattle was going on , as if nothing was said , and as if nobody was present . 
-- One morning Lady Angelica and Sir James Harcourt were looking over some portraits of the beauties of King Charles the Second 's time : Caroline was looking at them also , and for some time a conversation was carried on with the express intent of mortifying her . 
Caroline was so free from all ideas of rivalship , that she did not suspect them in others . 
She was surprised at the extraordinary judgments she heard pronounced , and honestly expressed her own different taste and opinion -- Mrs. Mortimer and Mr. Barclay both smiled at this ingenuous simplicity -- at length a glance of Sir James Harcourt 's , from one of the portraits to Lady Angelica 's face , told the secret to Caroline , who , though quite unsuspicious , was not , as Sir James began to believe , dull of apprehension . 
It was hoped , that she would now , when she understood the meaning of what passed , feel some degree of vexation ; but , on the contrary , she submitted with so good a grace , that it was evident she was not in the least mortified by having her own style of beauty undervalued by this acknowledged and fashionable connoisseur . 
-- Provoked by not being able to provoke Caroline , and exasperated by Mr. Barclay 's look , her Ladyship continued in exclusive conversation with Sir James Harcourt , determined to excite Mr. Barclay 's jealousy , and to bend or break his proud heart . 
Sir James admired her in every Proteus form of affectation . 
Mr. Barclay , as she thought , evidently pained by her coquetry , retired from the sofa where she sat , and went to Mrs. Hungerford 's table , where he took up a book and began to read . 
said she , drawing some cards from beneath Miss Caroline Percy 's elbow which rested on them . 
-- Mr. Barclay , '' continued her Ladyship , `` now if you have leisure to think of me , may I trouble you for some of your little cards for the attic of my dear Folly . '' 
Mr. Barclay coolly presented the cards to her Ladyship . 
The book was not to be found on the library table -- Mrs. Hungerford said , she believed it was in the Oriel -- Sir James went to look -- Miss Caroline Percy was drawing from it -- that was unlucky , for Mr. Barclay followed , stayed to admire Miss Percy 's drawings , which he had never seen before -- and in looking over these sketches of hers from Flaxman 's Homer , and from Euripides and Æschylus , which the Lady Pembrokes showed him , and in speaking of these , he discovered so much of Caroline 's taste , literature , and feeling , that he could not quit the Oriel . 
Lady Angelica had followed to prevent mischief , and Mrs. Hungerford had followed to enjoy the pleasure of seeing Caroline 's modest merit appreciated . 
Whilst Mr. Barclay admired in silence , Sir James Harcourt , not with his usual politeness , exclaimed : `` I protest I had no notion , that Miss Caroline Percy drew in this style . '' 
-- `` That 's possible , '' cried Lady Mary Pembroke , coloring , with that prompt indignation which she was prone to feel when any thing was said that seemed derogatory to her friends -- `` That 's possible , Sir James , and yet you find Miss Caroline Percy does draw in this very superior style -- Yes : and it is the perfection of her accomplishments , that they are never exhibited . '' 
-- When they had carried her out of the Oriel to the sofa in the library , and when her Ladyship found , that she had excited sufficient interest , and drawn the attention of Mr. Barclay away from Caroline ; her Ladyship began to grow a little better , and by graceful degrees recovered the use of her pretty limbs . 
-- And now , as she had reason to be satisfied with the degree of feeling , which Mr. Barclay had involuntarily shown for her when he thought she was ill , if her vanity had had any touch of gratitude or affection mixed with it , she would not have taken this moment to torment the heart of the man , ... the only man who ever really loved her -- But all in her was vanity -- She began to coquet with Sir James Harcourt -- she let him put on her sandal and tie it 's strings -- She sent him for her shawl , for she had a mind to walk in the park -- and when Mr. Barclay offered to attend her , and when she found that Caroline and the Lady Pembrokes were going , she had a mind not to go , and she resolved to detain them all in admiration of her . 
She took her shawl from Sir James , and throwing it round her in graceful drapery , she asked Sir James `` if he had ever seen any of Lady Hamilton 's attitudes , or rather scenic representations with shawl drapery . '' 
The whole fabric was raised a little from the fair head on which it seemed to grow -- Caroline sprang forward instantly , and dexterously disentangling the accomplished actress , relieved her from this imminent and awkward peril . 
`` I am sure I 'm exceedingly obliged to Miss Caroline Percy , '' said her Ladyship , adjusting her head-dress . 
`` There , now , all 's right again -- Thank you , Miss Percy -- Do n't trouble yourself , pray '' -- The heartless manner of these thanks , and her Ladyship 's preparing to go on again with her exhibition , so displeased and disgusted Mr. Barclay , that he left her to the flattery of Sir James Harcourt , and , sighing deeply , quitted the room . 
-- Is not she charming ! '' 
your friend , Miss Caroline Percy , I suppose -- Well ! 
though she is so great a favorite of yours , I must say , that , to my fancy , she is as little of an uncommon character as any girl I ever saw -- uncommon beauty , I acknowledge , she has , though not the style of face I like . '' 
`` Then , what makes her an uncommon character ? '' 
`` Her having this knowledge , understanding , and beauty , without one grain of vanity , affectation , or envy . '' 
`` Stay till you see her tried , '' said Lady Angelica ; stay till she has gone through one winter 's campaign in London -- Stay , till she has as many admirers as ... '' `` As you have , '' ... said Mrs. Hungerford , smiling -- `` she seems to be in a fair way of soon trying that experiment to your satisfaction . '' 
Miss Caroline Percy came into the room at this instant -- Lady Angelica went to her toilette to repair her charms . 
He determined to pay attentions to Miss Caroline Percy : his experience in the tactics of gallantry supplying the place of knowledge of the human heart , he counterfeited the symptoms of a new passion , and acted `` The Inconstant `` so well , that Lady Angelica had no doubt of his being what he appeared . 
In the mean time , Caroline 's character , the more it was brought into light , the more it 's value , goodness , and purity appeared . 
Without being rendered suspicious , Caroline had been so well accustomed to observe whether the action was suited to the word and the word to the action , that no one could , without offending her , `` overdo a passion , '' even a passion for herself . 
She saw at once , through his assumed appearance , that Sir James Harcourt had not the slightest attachment to her ; Rosamond also , whose penetration was quickened on this occasion by affection for her sister , discerned the truth immediately , and her indignation could scarcely be restrained . 
Caroline , on this occasion , when , perhaps , some little temptation might have been felt by some ladies , remembered her own prayer against coquetry , her manner towards Sir James was free from all possibility of reproach or misconstruction . 
And by simply and steadily adhering to the truth , and going the straight road , she avoided all the difficulties in which she would have been involved , had she deviated but for a moment into any crooked path . 
It may seem small praise , that she avoided all coquetry and deception by word or look ; yet those who know the world and the fair sex best will be inclined to have the highest opinion of a young lady , who entirely deserved this praise . 
Her Ladyship 's disdainful manner towards Caroline was thrown aside , `` And all the cruel language of the eye '' changed at once . 
Lady Angelica acknowledged , `` that no one could show more magnanimity , than Miss Caroline Percy had displayed in her conduct to Sir James Harcourt . '' 
-- This speech was made of course to be repeated , and when Caroline heard it , she could not help smiling at the word magnanimity , which sounded to her rather too grand for the occasion . 
-- She declared that `` she could not possibly disappoint Miss Kew -- besides , she had promised to carry Mr. Seebright to Weymouth , to introduce him and his poem to her friends , -- his subscription and the success of his poem entirely depended upon her going to Weymouth -- she could not possibly disappoint him . 
Mr. Barclay thought more of his own disappointment -- and said so -- at which her Ladyship rejoiced , for she wished to make this a trial of her power ; and she desired rather , that her reasons should not appear valid , and that her excuses should not be reasonable , on purpose that she might compel Mr. Barclay to submit to her caprice , and carry him off in triumph in her train . 
She carelessly repeated , that `` Leicestershire was out of the question at this time , but that Mr. Barclay might attend her , if he pleased . '' 
He saw that Miss Caroline Percy was all that could make him happy for life , if he could win her affections . 
He had , to be sure , some circumstances in his favor : he was of a good family , and had a considerable fortune ; in a worldly point of view he was a most advantageous match for Caroline Percy , but he knew , that an establishment was not the first object , either with her , or with her parents ; neither could he wish , that any motives of interest should operate in his favor . 
Caroline talked to him always as if she liked his conversation , and felt esteem for his character ; but the very freedom and ease of her manner showed , that she had no thoughts of him . 
-- He was many years older than Caroline : -- he was six and thirty , and she was eighteen , this did not amount to an absolute disparity , but it was an alarming difference . 
He caught a glimpse of Caroline one morning as she was drawing in the Oriel -- Her sister and the two Lady Pembrokes were in the library , and he thought he was secure of finding her alone . 
Her lips trembled and grew pale -- Mr. Barclay 's eyes fixed upon her for one moment with astonishment , then turning calmly away , he addressed himself to Caroline , his emotion recurring , though he merely spoke to her of a drawing which she was examining , and though he only said , `` Is this yours ? '' 
-- Caroline , without appearing to take any notice of this , turned to Mr. Barclay , and said -- `` Will you have the goodness now to give me the book , which you were so kind as to promise me ? '' 
Caroline proceeded with her drawing , gave Lady Angelica time to recover , and left her the hope , that her perturbation had not been noticed . 
-- Caroline waited some time in vain for Mr. Barclay and his book . 
Afterwards , as she was going up stairs , she was met by Rosamond , who , with a face full of mystery , whispered , `` Caroline ... my father wants you this instant in my mother 's dressing-room ... Mr. Barclay , '' -- added she , in a low voice , and nodding her head , `` Oh I see you know what I mean -- I knew he would propose for you , I said so last night . 
`` But my dear Rosamond , '' said Caroline , stopping Rosamond , `` let me beg that you will not mention this to the Lady Pembrokes . '' 
urged Caroline , eagerly . 
`` I think you might guess , '' said Caroline . 
Caroline heard from her father the confirmation of Rosamond 's intelligence , and she received from him and from her mother the kind assurance , that they would leave her entirely at liberty , to accept or refuse Mr. Barclay , according as her own judgment and feelings might dictate . 
`` And for Mr. Barclay 's '' -- said Caroline . 
`` Not all , perhaps , '' said Caroline , `` nor can I tell it you , because it is another person 's secret . 
Now , Caroline , '' continued her father , looking away from her , `` observe , I do not endeavor , from my knowledge of your countenance , even to guess whether what I imagine is fact . 
`` I never was told so , '' interrupted Caroline , `` but I have discovered it by accident ... No -- I have said too much -- I do not think that person is attached to him , but that she might easily have become attached , if this proposal had been made to her , instead of to me . 
`` My dear Caroline , '' said her father , `` I must put you upon your guard against the too easy faith of a sincere affectionate heart . 
repeated Caroline , `` Nobody upon Earth is more free from vanity and coquetry than . 
Both Mr. and Mrs. Percy were in doubt , whether Caroline was thinking of her sister Rosamond , or of her friend Lady Mary Pembroke ; but without attempting to discover , they only repeated that , whoever the person in question might be , or however amiable or dear to Caroline , she ought not to let this idea interfere with her own happiness , or influence her in giving an answer to Mr. Barclay 's proposal , which she ought either to accept or decline , according as her own feelings and judgment should decide . 
Mrs. Percy added , that perhaps Caroline might feel unwilling to take this advice , because she might have heard young ladies accused of coquetry , or jilting , who , after having delayed to give a decided answer to a proposal , had at last given a negative ; but she said she thought such censures were absurd and unjust , for that it was impossible a young woman could always determine at once , whether a gentleman , whose character she had had no opportunities of studying , and whom she had never considered as a lover , would suit her , and make her happy for life or not . 
`` In the present case , '' continued Mrs. Percy , `` your father and I will , if you wish to take time to decide , make Mr. Barclay clearly understand , that he is not to consider this as any encouragement , and as to the rest , '' -- added Mrs. Percy , `` when you are sure that you mean right , and that you do right , you will not , my dear Caroline , I hope , be deterred from determining upon what is best for your own happiness , merely by the weak fear of what idle foolish people will say about an affair in which they have no concern . '' 
Caroline assured her mother , that no such weak fear acted upon her mind ; and that in any case , where she had the least doubt whether she could like a person as a husband or not , she should certainly ask for time to consider , before she would give an answer : but that , with respect to Mr. Barclay , she had had sufficient opportunities of seeing and judging of him in the character of a lover , whilst he had been the admirer of Lady Angelica ; that she fully appreciated his good qualities , and was grateful for his favorable opinion ; but that she felt perfectly certain , that she did not and could not love him ; and therefore she desired , as soon as possible , to put him out of the pain of suspense , to prevent him from having the mortification of showing himself the admirer of one , by whom he must ultimately be refused ; and to leave him at liberty to turn his thoughts elsewhere , to some person to whom he was better suited , and who was better suited to him . 
-- These hopes had been checked , and for a moment overthrown by Mr. Barclay 's appearance this morning in the Oriel ; the emotion with which she saw him speak to Caroline , and the indifference with which she heard him wish her Ladyship health and happiness at Weymouth , or wherever she went , for an instant convinced her of the truth . 
-- But obstinate vanity recurred to the hope , that he was not yet irreclaimable , and under this persuasion she hurried on the preparations for her departure , impatient for the moment of crisis -- of triumph . 
-- But trunks packed and corded gave no pang to her former lover -- Mrs. Hungerford did not press her to stay -- Mr. Barclay handed her into the carriage -- she stooped to conquer , so far as to tell him , that , `` as she had only Mr. Seebright and her maid , she could give him a seat in her carriage , if he would come to Weymouth , and that she would thence , in a fortnight at farthest , go to his aunt , dear Lady B -- , in Leicestershire . '' 
She said , that there was no occasion to pity him , because he was only soberly and quietly in love ; that he had compared , and judged , and calculated well ; that , after casting up his moral accounts , he had found , that between Lady Angelica Headingham , and Miss Caroline Percy , the balance of good qualities , and the chance of domestic happiness stood in favor of the latter , wherefore he had to her transferred his heart . 
Perhaps Rosamond was not interested in Mr. Barclay 's favor , because there appeared no difficulty in his way ; she thought that Caroline esteemed him more , and was more likely to marry him , than any other gentleman she had seen ; and then the dénouement would be too near , too clear , and commonplace . 
-- Rosamond said , that `` in this case Caroline would just be married like any body else , to a man with a good fortune , good character , good sense , and every thing very good , but nothing extraordinary , and she would be settled at Mr. Barclay 's seat in Leicestershire , and she would be Mrs. Barclay , and , perhaps , happy enough , but nothing extraordinary . '' 
-- She was relieved , when at last Caroline surprised her with the assurance , that there was no probability of Mr. Barclay 's succeeding in his suit . 
`` And yet , '' said Caroline , `` if I were compelled at this moment to marry , of all men I have ever yet seen Mr. Barclay is the person , to whom I could engage myself with the least reluctance -- the person with whom I think I should have the best security for happiness . '' 
-- `` If that is the case , '' said she , `` though you have no intention of marrying him at present , you will , I suppose , be reasoned into marrying him in time . '' 
-- `` No , '' said Caroline , `` for I can not be reasoned into loving him . '' 
`` There 's my own , dear Caroline , '' cried Rosamond , `` I was horribly afraid , that this man of sense would have convinced you , that esteem was quite sufficient without love . '' 
said Caroline . 
-- `` For what else could I marry , '' continued Caroline , `` I who am left by the kindest of parents freely to my own choice -- could I marry , -- for a house in Leicestershire ? 
said Caroline , with a look of such surprise , that Rosamond was obliged to fall immediately to protestations , and appeals to common sense . 
`` No common degree of love , and no common love , would be sufficient to induce me to marry , '' -- said Caroline . 
-- `` But to return to Mr. Barclay , '' said Caroline . 
-- `` I am heartily glad that you love me , but I am not sensible of my present immediate claim to your love by my touch of human absurdity , '' said Caroline , smiling . 
`` I dare not tell you , that there is yet no danger of his breaking his heart , '' said Caroline . 
`` I should , '' said Caroline ; `` especially as he has just ordered his carriage to take him to his aunt , Lady B -- , in Leicestershire . '' 
`` No , Caroline -- you are very cruel -- because I am sure he is very much touched and disappointed by your refusal . 
Rosamond , however , returned a few minutes afterwards , to complain that Mr. Barclay had not made efforts enough to persuade Caroline to listen to him . 
Caroline had managed so well by not managing at all , that Lady Mary , far from guessing the real cause of Mr. Barclay 's sudden departure , repeatedly expressed surprise , that her aunt Hungerford did not press him to stay a little longer ; and once said , she `` wondered how Mr. Barclay could leave Hungerford-Castle whilst Caroline was there , -- that she had begun to think he had formed an attachment , which would do him more honor than his passion for Lady Angelica Headingham , but that she feared he would have a relapse of that fit of folly , and that it would at last end fatally in marriage . '' 
-- Mrs. Hungerford smiled at the openness , with which her niece told her conjectures , and at the steadiness with which Caroline kept Mr. Barclay 's secret , by saying no more than just the thing she ought . 
-- You would convince me of this , if I had doubted it , '' said Mrs. Hungerford to Caroline . 
Caroline felt , that this lady had seen deeply into her mind , and that she appreciated her fully . 
Caroline endeavoured , but could not well express in words what she felt at this instant . 
-- I believe in disinterested affection , taking the word disinterested in it 's proper sense ; and I have still , believe me , the power of sympathising with a young friend , -- such a young friend as Caroline Percy . 
Early as it is with her in life , she has so cultivated her understanding , so regulated her mind , that she can not consider friendship merely as a companionship in frivolous amusement , or a mixture of gossipping confidences and idle sentiment ; therefore , I am proud enough to hope , that she can and will be the friend of such an old woman as I am . '' 
-- `` It would be the pride of my life , to have -- to deserve such a friend , '' cried Caroline -- `` I feel all the condescension of this kindness . 
Every thing conspired to give Caroline a favorable idea of Colonel Hungerford . 
None of these shades of manner were lost upon Caroline 's discriminating observation . 
Caroline had taken an interest in the military profession , ever since her eldest brother had gone into the army . 
Caroline observed this , and wished and hoped , that , when her brother should have had as many opportunities of improvement , as Colonel Hungerford 's experience had given him , he might be just such a man . 
-- After he had been some time at home , and that every day more and more of his amiable character had been developed , Rosamond said to herself , `` This is certainly the man for Caroline , and I suspect she begins to think so . 
-- If she does not , I never will forgive her . '' 
One day , when the sisters were by themselves , Rosamond tried to sound Caroline on this subject . 
She began , as she thought , at a safe distance from her main object . 
`` Very much and very deservedly , '' answered Caroline . 
-- She spoke without any hesitation or embarrassment . 
-- Caroline was silent . 
Full assent again from Caroline both of look and voice -- but still not the exact look and voice Rosamond desired . 
`` Do you know , Caroline , '' continued she , `` I think , that in several things Colonel Hungerford is very like my brother Godfrey . '' 
`` Yes , and in some points , I think Colonel Hungerford is superior to Godfrey , '' said Caroline . 
-- repeated Caroline , smiling -- `` that includes a great deal . '' 
-- Caroline expressed strong gratitude for Mrs. Hungerford 's kindness to her , and the warmest return of affection . 
... I think she not only loves you , as if you were her daughter , but that ... now confess , Caroline , did not the idea ever occur to you ? 
`` You have a right to it , '' -- said Caroline -- `` I see , my dear sister , and feel all your kindness towards me , and all Mrs. Hungerford 's -- I see what you both wish . '' 
`` There 's my own sister Caroline , above all artifice and affectation . '' 
`` But , '' said Caroline . 
Caroline , do n't go back -- do n't ` palter with us , in a double sense . ' 
`` Every thing against which the heart of woman should guard itself , '' said Caroline . 
-- It is no crime ... except , perhaps , in your eyes , '' dear Rosamond ... '' said Caroline , smiling -- `` no crime not to love me . '' 
`` I do not recollect that I said I feared it , '' said Caroline . 
`` Laugh , but hear me , '' said Caroline -- `` I make no professions of stoicism ; it is because I am conscious that I am no stoic , that I have endeavoured to guard well my heart . 
said Caroline . 
... '' `` If there be no harm , theré might be much danger , '' said Caroline , `` better not to think of the subject at all , since we can do no good by thinking of it , and may do harm . '' 
-- `` Better , no doubt , '' said Rosamond -- `` Right , no doubt , and fine as any maxim of philosophy I ever heard -- in theory -- but the practice is the difficulty -- I wo n't say the impossibility -- But Seriously and honestly , Caroline , would you have me believe that you have never ... never thought of Colonel Hungerford . '' 
-- `` No ; I assure you that I do not feel any partiality , '' said Caroline , `` and you may , you must believe me . '' 
Caroline ? '' 
`` I never thought any such thing , '' answered Caroline , `` and I expressed myself very ill if I said any such thing . 
`` I never heard that it was a man 's supreme merit to love , '' said Caroline , `` but we are not at present inquiring , what is a man 's , but what is a woman 's characteristic excellence . 
`` I can well imagine it , '' said Caroline , `` fortunately I have never felt it . 
`` Glory there is none , '' said Caroline , `` nor do I claim any merit ; but is not it something to prevent struggle and difficulty ? 
''' `` That is a masculine , not a feminine proverb , '' said Caroline , `` else , acting upon that principle , we should come presently to a bold stroke for a husband . '' 
Rosamond blushed , retracted her proverb , and utterly disclaimed the idea of a bold stroke . 
said Caroline . 
my dear , dear Caroline , that could never be -- God forbid ! 
-- cried Rosamond , with a look of terror -- but recovering herself , she added , -- `` This is a vain fear . 
said Caroline . 
`` All very right and very true , '' said Rosamond -- `` But for a young person , Caroline , I could spare some of this premature reason . 
Caroline colored -- paused -- and when she answered , she spoke in a lower and graver tone and manner than usual . 
-- But , my dear Caroline , do not speak so very seriously , and do not look with such ` sweet austere composure . ' 
At these words tears filled Caroline 's eyes . 
Mrs. Hungerford , '' she exclaimed , `` in the warmth of her heart , in the fullness of her kindness for me , once in her life Mrs. Hungerford said perhaps an imprudent word , expressed a wish , of which her better judgment may have repented . '' 
should you think she has repented of it , Caroline ? '' 
`` Because she must by this time see , that there is no probability of that wish being accomplished . 
-- She must , therefore , desire that it should be forgotten . 
-- But if I had built a romance upon that slight word , consider how much that excellent friend would blame herself , when she found that she had misled me , that she had been the cause of anguish to my heart -- that she had lowered , in the opinion of all , even in her own opinion , the girl she had once so exalted by her approbation and friendship . 
-- My dear Caroline , you have opened my eyes ... you have brought a host of terrors upon me ! '' 
said Caroline , smiling , `` it might have been terrible indeed to me , that Colonel Hungerford should love another , if I had become attached to him ; but I have avoided that misery , -- and now , if my friend should be the object of his preference , I can rejoice and sympathize in her happiness . '' 
Then you have acted wisely , rightly , Caroline ; and I have as usual been very , very imprudent . 
-- `` Yes , '' answered Caroline . 
-- Lady Elizabeth Pembroke and Caroline had both been copying a picture of Sir Philip Sidney when a boy . 
Colonel Hungerford instantly distinguished it , and , in strong terms , expressed his admiration ; but , by some mistake , he fancied that both copies were done by Caroline ; she explained to him that that which he preferred was Lady Elizabeth 's . 
-- Caroline gently relieved Mrs. Hungerford 's hand from her copy of the picture which she still held . 
-- Mrs. Hungerford rose deliberately -- Caroline offered her arm . 
-- `` I am afraid , '' -- said Mrs. Hungerford , as she leaned more upon Caroline . 
said Caroline , `` not in the least . '' 
`` And with pleasure , I am sure , you now give him up , secure of his happiness , '' -- said Caroline . 
Mrs. Hungerford stopped short , and looked full on Caroline , upon whom she had previously avoided to turn her eyes . 
-- From what anxiety did Caroline 's serene , open countenance , and sweet ingenuous smile , at this instant , relieve her friend . 
Old as she was , Mrs. Hungerford had quick and strong feelings . 
-- She held out her arms to Caroline , and folded her to her heart . 
said she , -- `` Child of my affections -- that you must ever be ! '' 
my dear Madam , '' cried Rosamond , `` You have no idea how unjust and imprudent I have been about Caroline . '' 
-- `` Dear Rosamond , do not reproach yourself ; for your excessive kindness to me , '' -- said Caroline , `` In candor and generous feeling , who is equal to you ? '' 
Do come and look at them -- but stay , first I have a favor to beg of you , Caroline . 
I know Gustavus will ask my sister to ride with him this morning , and the flies torment her horse so , and she is such a coward , that she will not be able to listen to a word that is said to her ... Could you lend her your pretty gentle White Surrey ? '' 
`` With pleasure , '' said Caroline , `` and my net . '' 
-- Rosamond , as she sewed on the fringe , sighed , -- and worked , -- and wished it was for Caroline , and said to herself . 
And she felt vexed ... as a child when the table is suddenly shaken , and it 's card house is thrown down ; disconsolate as a philosopher , convinced , against his will , that his favorite castle in the air is but a baseless fabric . 
Rosamond ran down stairs with the net ; Caroline had it put on her horse , and Lady Elizabeth Pembroke thanked her with such a look of kindness , of secure faith in her friend 's sympathy , that even Rosamond forgave her for being happy . 
Caroline , tenderly and gratefully attached to Mrs. Hungerford , found it very difficult and painful to part from her ; the more painful because she feared to express all the affection , admiration , and gratitude she felt for this excellent friend , lest , if she yielded to the natural sensibility of her heart , her emotion might be misinterpreted . 
When she took leave of Caroline , she kissed her at first in silence , and then , by a few strong words , and more by her manner than by her words , expressed her high esteem and affection for her young friend . 
Regretted by young and old , at peace in her own mind , `` That sweet peace , which goodness bosoms ever , '' Caroline returned home , satisfied with the present , and not anxious for the future . 
`` My Dear Mother , Notwithstanding Rosamond 's dread of such a commonplace ending for her heroine , I own , that from all I have heard to Mr. Barclay , if he had been but ten years ' younger , and a little more of a laughing philosopher ... and if Caroline could but have loved him , I should have been very glad to have had him for a brother-in-law ; but since these things can not be , I regret as little as possible , that the Leicestershire estate is not to come into our family , and that I have not the drawing of the marriage settlements . 
Buckhurst Falconer used to be my newspaper , but since he has given up all hopes of Caroline , he seldom comes near me . 
-- I know very little of her , but Caroline assures me she is an amiable , sensible woman , well suited to him , and to all his family . 
-- I need not , however , expatiate on this subject , for Caroline says that she wrote you a long letter , the day after she returned from Hungerford-Castle . 
-- But ... Caroline and Rosamond , at this instant , have appeared at each of my elbows , and summon me out to walk with them . 
-- My love to my dear mother , Rosamond , and Caroline . 
Affectionately yours , Caroline Percy . '' 
Another letter from Caroline to Erasmus , dated some weeks after the preceding : Tuesday , 14th . 
I have been as conveniently and meritoriously deaf , blind , and stupid for some time past , as possible -- But though I shut my eyes , and stop my ears , yet my imagination will act , and I can only say to myself , as we used to do when we were children , `` I will not think of it till it comes , that I may have the pleasure of the surprise -- **** Affectionately yours , Caroline Percy . '' 
Caroline was right -- Rosamond had made a great impression upon Mr. Gresham 's heart . 
Both Mrs. Percy and Caroline were inclined to think , that Rosamond had not only a high opinion of Mr. Gresham , but that she had felt a preference for him , which she had never before shown for any other person -- and they thought that , perhaps , some refinement of delicacy about accepting his large fortune , or some fear that his want of high birth , and what are called good connexions , would be objected to by her father and mother , might be the cause of this refusal . 
Mrs. Percy felt extremely anxious to explain her own sentiments , and fully to understand Rosamond 's feelings -- In this anxiety Caroline joined most earnestly ; all the kindness , sympathy , and ardent affection , which Rosamond had ever shown for her , when the interests of her heart were in question , were strong in Caroline 's recollection , and these were now fully returned . 
Caroline thought Mr. Gresham was too old for her sister , but she considered that this objection , and all others , should yield to Rosamond 's own opinion and taste . 
Though parents are accused of always rating ' a good estate above a faithful lover , ' yet you will recollect , that Mr. Barclay 's good estate did not induce us to press his suit with Caroline . 
Mr. Gresham has a large fortune ; and , to speak in Lady Jane Granville 's style , it must be acknowledged , my dear Rosamond , that this would be a most advantageous match ; but for this very reason we are particularly desirous , that you should determine for yourself -- At the same time let me tell you , that I am a little surprised by the promptness of your decision -- Let me be sure , that this negative is serious -- Let me be sure , that I rightly understand you , my Love -- Now , when only your own Caroline is present , tell me what are your objections to Mr. Gresham ? '' 
`` No , indeed , mother , you need not smile -- nor you , Caroline -- for the sort of pity which I feel is not akin to ... it was merely pity , by itself plain pity -- Why should people imagine and insist upon it , that more is felt than is expressed ? '' 
-- Now Caroline ! 
cried Caroline ; `` but , my dear Rosamond , with your generous mind you know it is quite impossible , that you should marry from interested motives . '' 
do not , my dearest Rosamond , '' said Caroline , taking her sister 's hand , pressing it between hers , and speaking in the most urgent , almost supplicating tone , do not , generous as you are , sacrifice your happiness to mistaken delicacy ! '' 
-- I do not like to marry a man who is not a hero -- You are very good not to laugh , Caroline '' -- `` Indeed , I am too seriously interested at present to laugh '' -- said Caroline . 
-- `` And those , perhaps , not the least happy of human beings , '' said Caroline -- `` Be that as it may , I think it can not be denied , that Mr. Gresham has , in a high degree , one of the qualities which ought to distinguish a hero . '' 
`` Generosity , '' replied Caroline -- `` and his large fortune , puts it in his power to show that quality upon a scale , more extended than is usually allowed , even to the heroes of romance . '' 
-- If he marry beneath himself , his low wife is immediately raised by her wedding-ring to an equality with the high and mighty husband -- her name is forgotten in her title , -- her vulgar relations are left in convenient obscurity ; the husband never thinks of taking notice of them ; and the wife , of course , may let it alone if she pleases -- But a woman , in our rank of life , usually bears her husband 's name , and must also bear all his relations , be they ever so vulgar -- Now , Caroline , honestly -- how should you like this ? '' 
`` Honestly , not at all , '' said Caroline ; `` but as we can not have every thing we like , or avoid every thing we dislike in life , we must balance the good against the evil , when we are to make our choice -- And if I found certain amiable , estimable qualities in a character , I think that I might esteem , love , and marry him , even though he had a vulgar name , and vulgar connexions . 
Caroline still believing , that Rosamond was only bringing forward all the objections that might be raised against her wishes , replied -- `` Fortunately , my dear Rosamond , you are not called upon for any such effort of philosophy , for Mr. Gresham is not vulgar , nor is even his name vulgar , and he can not have any vulgar relations , because he has no relations of any description -- I heard him say , the other day , that he was an isolated being . '' 
come , my dear Caroline , do n't speak against your conscience -- You know you never could withstand the hordes of vulgarians . '' 
`` These vulgarians in buckram , '' said Caroline , `` have grown from two to two hundred in a trice , in your imagination , Rosamond -- but consider that Old Panton , against whom you have such an invincible horror , will , now that he has quarrelled with Erasmus , probably very soon eat himself out of the world ; and I do n't see that you are bound to Mr. Gresham 's dead partner 's widow -- Is this your only objection to Mr. Gresham ? '' 
no , do n't flatter yourself , that in killing Old Panton you have struck off all my objections -- Independently of vulgar relations , or connexions , my grand objection remains -- But I will address myself to my mother , for you are not a good person for judging of prejudices -- You really do n't understand them , my dear Caroline -- One might as well talk to Socrates -- You go to work with logic , and get one between the horns of a wicked dilemma directly -- I will talk to my mother , she understands prejudices . '' 
cried Caroline , with a look of joyful triumph , `` there ! 
-- But looking at Rosamond at this moment , she saw no expression of joy or pleasure in her countenance ; and Caroline was now convinced , that she had been mistaken about Rosamond 's feelings . 
When she recovered her voice , she assured her mother and Caroline , with a seriousness and an earnest frankness , which at once convinced them of her truth , that she had not the slightest partiality for Mr. Gresham . 
The Lady Angelica Headingham now bethought herself , that she had a little poem , written by Mr. Alfred Percy , which had been given to her long ago by Miss Percy , and of which , at the time she received it , her Ladyship had thought so little , that , hardly deigning to bestow the customary tribute of a compliment , she had thrown it , scarcely perused , into her writing box . 
It was now worth while to rummage for it , and now , when the author had a name , her Ladyship discovered `` that the poem was charming ! 
To save the lives of so many judges , Alfred consented to lose an evening -- the day was fixed -- Alfred found her conversazione very brilliant -- was admired -- and admired others in his turn as much as was expected . 
-- It was an agreeable variety of company and of thought to him , and he promised to go sometimes to her Ladyship 's parties . 
-- A promise which delighted her much , particularly as he had not yet given a copy of the verses to Lady Spilsbury . 
Alfred knew , that there had been some misunderstanding between Lady Jane and his family , that she had been offended by his sister Caroline 's having declined accepting her invitation to town , and from Mr. and Mrs. Percy 's having differed with her in opinion as to the value of the patronage of fashion . 
`` A thousand thanks to dear Caroline for her letter , and to Rosamond for her journal . 
`` I am glad that Caroline did not marry Mr. Barclay , since she did not like him . 
But by all accounts he is a sensible , worthy man , and I give my consent to his marriage with Lady Mary Pembroke , though , from Caroline 's description , I became half in love with her myself . 
`` MY DEAR CAROLINE , '' `` I am going to surprise you -- I know it is the most imprudent thing a story-teller can do , to give notice , or promise of a surprise -- but you see , I have such confidence at this moment in my fact , that I hazard this imprudence -- Who do you think I have seen ? 
Guess -- guess all round the breakfast table -- father , mother , Caroline , Rosamond -- I defy you all -- Ay , Rosamond , even you , with all your capacity for romance ; the romance of real life is beyond all other romances ; it 's coincidences beyond the combinations of the most inventive fancy -- even of yours , Rosamond -- Granted -- go on -- Patience , ladies , if you please , and do n't turn over the page , or glance to the end of my letter to satisfy your curiosity , but read fairly on , says my father . 
`` Well , Caroline , you are surprised , -- ` No , ' says Rosamond , ` I guessed it was him , from the first moment I heard he was a foreigner , and had a noble air -RRB- . ' 
Even from the glance I have had I can decide , that this Count Altenberg is a superior person , there is something about him so commanding , and yet so engaging , ... But I will not overpraise him -- Adieu , dearest Caroline . 
One of them was covered with coats of arms : the other represented the fire at Percy-Hall , and the portrait of Caroline , assisting the old nurse down the staircase . 
This painting immediately fixed Count Altenberg 's eye , and Miss Georgiana Falconer , not knowing whose portrait it was , exclaimed , as she looked at the figure of Caroline , `` Beautiful ! 
Count Altenberg , without moving his eye , repeated , `` It is the most beautiful face , I ever beheld . '' 
`` Miss Caroline Percy , Ma'am . '' 
-- Of the presence of mind and humanity of Miss Caroline Percy , who had saved the life of the poor decrepit woman , who in the picture was represented as leaning upon her arm . 
`` I am amazed , how you could see any likeness in that face or figure to Lady Anne Cope , or Lady Mary Nesbitt , or any of the Arlingtons , '' said Miss Georgiana Falconer , looking through her hand at the portrait of Caroline . 
-- The Commissioner had not been present when the Count saw the picture of Caroline , nor indeed did he enter into Mrs. Falconer 's matrimonial designs for her daughter Georgiana . 
-- Miss Georgiana hoped that they should , at least , see Miss Caroline Percy -- she owned she was curious to see that beautiful original , of whom the painter at Percy -- Hall , and her brother Buckhurst , had said so much . '' 
Caroline had taken a walk with her father to a considerable distance . 
Once or twice they turned their heads with some signs of vivacity , when the door opened , and when they expected to see Miss Caroline Percy enter : but though the visit was protracted , in hopes of her return , yet at last they were obliged to depart without having their curiosity satisfied . 
By those of the family whom she saw this day , she judged of Caroline , whom she had not seen ; and she had tact sufficient to apprehend , that the conversation and manners of Mrs. Percy and of Rosamond were such , as might , perhaps , please a well-bred and well-informed foreigner , better , even , than the fashionable tone and air of the day , of which he had not been long enough in England to appreciate the conventional value . 
-- At this triumphant moment Miss Georgiana could have seen , with security and complacency , the arrival of Miss Caroline Percy . 
... '' Then turning towards Caroline -- `` Miss Caroline Percy , I am sure , though I had never , till now , the pleasure of seeing her . '' 
An introduction of Caroline by Mrs. Percy , in due form , took place -- Mrs. Falconer next recognised Mr. Percy , declared he did not look a day older than when she had seen him fifteen years before -- Then recurring to the ladies -- `` But , my dear Mrs. Percy , are you sure that your shoes are not wet through ? 
my dear Madam , Miss Percy 's are terribly wet ! 
and Miss Caroline 's ! 
-- Positively the young ladies must go to my dressing room , the shoes must be dried '' -- Mrs. Falconer said , that `` perhaps her daughters could accommodate the Miss Percys with others . '' 
Rosamond was permitted , without much difficulty , to do as she pleased , but Mrs. Falconer 's infinite fears , lest Caroline should catch her death of cold , could not be appeased , till she had submitted to change her shoes . 
`` Caroline ! '' 
said Rosamond , in a low voice , `` Caroline ! 
-- It is better to yield , than to debate the point any longer , '' said Caroline . 
When they returned to the ball-room , Count Altenberg was in earnest conversation with Mr. Percy , but Mrs. Falconer observed , that the Count saw Miss Caroline Percy the moment she reappeared . 
thought she , `` when Georgiana dances so well ! 
It was not her appearance that struck him . 
-- But a favorable impression had been made on his mind by what he had previously heard of Miss Caroline Percy 's conduct and character ; her appearance confirmed this impression precisely , because she had not the practised air of a professed beauty , because she did not seem in the least to be thinking of herself , or to expect admiration . 
-- He asked Caroline to dance ; she declined dancing . 
-- Mr. Temple engaged Rosamond , and the moment he led her away , the Count availed himself of her place , and a conversation commenced , which soon made Mrs. Falconer regret , that Caroline had declined dancing . 
She began talking to an old lady about her late illness , of which she longed to hear from her own lips all the particulars ; and whilst the old lady told her case , Mrs. Falconer , with eyes fixed upon her , and making , at proper intervals , all the appropriate changes of countenance requisite to express tender sympathy , alarm , horror , astonishment , and joyful congratulation , contrived , at the same time , through the whole progress of fever , and the administration of half the medicines in the London Pharmacopoeia , to hear every thing that was said by Count Altenberg , and not to lose a word that was uttered by Caroline . 
-- Every person who spoke to , or of Caroline -- and he heard many speak of her who had known her from childhood -- spoke with affection in their countenance and manner . 
As they were returning into the ball-room , Rosamond watched her opportunity , made her way along a passage which led to Mrs. Falconer 's dressing-room , seized her sister 's shoes , returned with the prize before Caroline reached the antichamber , and , unseen by all , made her put them on -- `` Now promise me not to refuse to dance , if you are asked again . '' 
-- Count Altenberg engaged Miss Georgiana Falconer the first two dances -- When these were finished , he asked Caroline to dance , and Mrs. Falconer , who dreaded the renewal of conversation between them and who knew nothing of Rosamond 's counter-manoeuvre about the shoes , was surprised and rejoiced , when she saw Caroline comply , and suffer herself to be led out by Count Altenberg -- But Miss Georgiana , who had observed that Rosamond danced well , had fears -- The mother 's hopes were disappointed , the daughter 's fears were justified . 
-- Caroline showed all the capability of dancing without being a dancer , and it certainly did not escape the Count 's observation , that she possessed what is most desirable in female accomplishments , the power to excel , without the wish to display -- Immediately after she had finished these dances , the favor of her hand was solicited by a certain Colonel Spandrill . 
However it was settled , that he only danced with Miss Percy , because Mrs. Falconer had made it her particular request . 
One of these ladies declared , she had over-heard that request ; Colonel Spandrill then was safe from all blame , but the full fire of their resentment was directed against poor Caroline . 
Every feature of her face was criticised , and even the minutiæ of her dress . 
They all allowed that she was handsome , but each found some different fault with her style of beauty . 
It was curious to observe , how this secondary class of young ladies , who had without discomfiture or emotion seen Caroline the object of Count Altenberg 's attention , were struck with indignation , the moment they suspected her of pleasing Colonel Spandrill . 
These ladies having no hope of captivating Count Altenberg , Caroline did not then appear to be their rival , but now that they dreaded her competition with a man whom they had hopes of winning , they pulled her to pieces without mercy . 
Yet there was something in Caroline 's unaffected unassuming manner , which might have disarmed the rage of malice ; and this indeed was observed by the few who were unprejudiced and dispassionate spectators . 
Count Altenberg was at that moment beating time with his foot , in exact cadence to Miss Caroline Percy 's dancing -- Miss Falconer saw this , but not till she had uttered her question , not till it had been observed by all her companions , -- Lady Frances Arlington half smiled , and half a smile instantly appeared along a whole line of young ladies . 
In the mean time Colonel Spandrill and Caroline had finished their dance ; and the Colonel , who made it a principle to engross the attention of the prettiest woman in the room , was now , after his manner , paying his adorations to his fair partner . 
She had purposely introduced the gallant Colonel Spandrill to the Miss Percys , in the hope that Caroline 's head , like that of many other young ladies , might be affected by flattery ; and that she might not then retain all that dignity of manner , which , as Mrs. Falconer had sense enough to see , was her distinguishing charm in the eyes of Count Altenberg . 
-- It was not the circumstance of meeting Caroline at a ball , that made this impression on Count Altenberg . 
-- Count Altenberg had not , as they fancied , fallen desperately in love at first sight with Caroline -- He had only been pleased , and interested sufficiently to make him desirous to see more of her . 
-- Caroline , though so much the object of jealousy , had not the slightest idea , that she had made a conquest . 
-- She simply thought the Count 's conversation agreeable , and she was glad that she should see him again at breakfast the next morning . 
With his usual penetration , Lord Oldborough soon discerned the characteristics of each of the ladies of this family -- the good sense and good breeding of Mrs. Percy -- the wit and generous simplicity of Rosamond ; the magnanimity and superior understanding of Caroline . 
His treasuring up all he had seen abroad , that could be useful at home , reminded Caroline of Colonel Hungerford ; but she observed that Count Altenberg 's views were more enlarged ; he was unbiassed by professional habits ; his sphere of action was higher ; heir to extensive property , with all the foreign rights of territorial dominion hereditarily his ; and with a probability of obtaining the political power of ministerial station ; plans , which in other circumstances might have been romantic , with Count Albert 's prospects and abilities were within the bounds of sound judgment and actual practicability . 
Caroline , leaning on her father 's arm , listened with a countenance full of intelligence , animation , and sympathy : she looked , alternately , at the Count and at her father , whose satisfaction she saw and enjoyed . 
During this walk , though Caroline said but little , yet that little , to a man of the Count 's discernment , was sufficient to show good judgment and great capacity . 
-- This increased the admiration and interest , which her beauty and manners , and all he had heard of her conduct , created . 
It is certain that with the celerity of intuition , of sympathy , or of practised penetration , Count Albert perceived Caroline 's intellectual superiority . 
He had been , at first , curious to discover whether her mental qualifications were equal to her extraordinary personal beauty ; but he had soon forgotten his intention of trying her abilities , in anxiety to convince her of his own . 
The whole turn and style of his conversation now proved , more than any compliment could possibly have shown , the high opinion he had of her understanding , and of the elevation of her mind . 
-- A woman may always judge of the real estimation in which she is held , by the conversation which is addressed to her . 
-- Mr. Temple had taken them to see a fine view ; Mr. Percy proposed to sit down and quietly wait their return ; Caroline and the Count seemed to have no objection to oblige him , and they placed themselves under a spreading beech . 
... I should have been here a full hour sooner , but that my ladies were so late at breakfast after sitting up -- And I thought your ladies might have been fatigued too ... but Miss Caroline Percy I see , fresh as a rose -- '' The Commissioner then , as if half in jest , half in earnest , paid Caroline a profusion of compliments upon her appearance the preceding night -- numbered , on his fingers , the conquests she had made , and the hearts she had broken -- Mrs. Percy , Rosamond , and Mr. Temple came up , and , as soon as they had expressed their raptures on the beauty of the view , Mr. Falconer presented his note from Mrs. Falconer to Mrs. Percy , to which , he said , he was most anxious to be the bearer of a favorable answer , as he knew that he should otherwise be ill-received at home , and the disappointment would be great . 
-- Whether it was to be Zara or Cato , they had not yet positively decided -- for Cato they were in terrible distress for a Marcia -- Could Miss Caroline Percy be prevailed upon to try Marcia ? 
She would look the part so well , and , no doubt , act it so well -- Or if she preferred Zara , Miss Georgiana Falconer would , with pleasure , take the part of the confidante . 
-- Dresses in great forwardness , Turkish or Roman , convertible , in a few hours ' notice , should wait Miss Percy 's decision . 
`` Well , my dear Caroline , what say you ? '' 
Caroline was going to answer -- `` No , no , do n't answer yet , '' interrupted the Commissioner , `` let me add , what I find Mrs. Falconer took it for granted I would say , that there can be no possible difficulty or inconvenience , about the goings and comings , and horses , and carriages , and beds , and all those sort of things -- for our horses and carriages can have nothing to do , whilst the ladies are rehearsing ... shall attend you any day -- any hour -- and beds we can contrive -- So , I beseech you , let none of these vulgar sublunary considerations deprive us of a Zara or a Marcia -- But say , which shall it be ? 
-- When he heard Caroline pronounce , with great politeness , a refusal , for the first moment he looked disappointed , but the next seemed satisfied and pleased . 
-- It would have highly gratified and interested him , to have seen Caroline act either the sublime or the tender heroine , but he preferred seeing her support her own character with modest dignity . 
Commissioner Falconer pleaded and pressed in vain ; Caroline was steady in her refusal , though the manner of it was so gentle , that every instant he thought he should vanquish her reluctance . 
-- Caroline understood and gave him credit for his politeness . 
-- Count Altenberg continued talking to Caroline till the last moment , and after he had handed her into the carriage , as he took leave of Mr. Percy , he said that he had to thank him and his family for some of the most agreeable among the many agreeable hours he had passed since he came to England . 
Caroline said how often , during their walk , she had regretted her mother and sister 's absence . 
She recollected and reminded her father of some of the striking circumstances they had heard , and Mr. Percy and she repeated so many curious and interesting anecdotes , so many just observations and noble sentiments , that Mrs. Percy and Rosamond were quite charmed with the Count . 
Rosamond , however , was surprised by the openness and ease , with which Caroline praised and talked of this gentleman . 
`` I will say nothing , '' thought she -- `` for I am determined to be prudent this time . 
-- Only this I may and must think , that Caroline can not , without affectation , avoid seeing that she has made a conquest . '' 
-- Mistaken again , Rosamond -- Caroline had neither seen nor suspected it . 
-- Count Altenberg 's gratitude for the hospitality shown to his countrymen at the time of the shipwreck , his recent acquaintance with her brother Alfred , and all he had heard of her father from the grateful tenants at Percy-Hall , accounted , as Caroline justly thought , for the eagerness he had shown to be introduced to her family . 
His conversing so much with her she thought was natural , as he was a stranger to most of the company , and had some subjects of conversation in common with her and her family . 
-- Caroline was not apt to imagine admiration in every word or look ; she was not expert in construing every compliment into a declaration or an innuendo of love . 
It had been on subjects so interesting , that she had been carried on without having had time to think of love . 
A good and great character had opened to her view , and she had been so absorbed in sympathy , that though she had thought of nothing but Count Altenberg , she had never thought of him with any reference to herself . 
Caroline , in her own family , at her home , pleased Count Altenberg particularly , -- The interest he felt about her increased , and he afterwards took or made frequent opportunities of calling at the Hills : His conversation was generally addressed to Mr. Percy , but he observed Caroline with peculiar attention -- and Rosamond was confirmed in her opinion . 
-- Caroline pursued her usual occupations with a well regulated mind , yet not without a wish frequently recurring , to see and hear more of Count Altenberg . 
Her father and mother were still more anxious on this subject , -- they both agreed in thinking , that , as far as they had yet seen , Count Altenberg was a person suited to Caroline , in every respect a man to whom , on every account but one , they could heartily wish to see her united . 
-- On every account but one -- he was a foreigner , and if she were to marry him , they would lose her , perhaps , for ever . 
-- However , they thought and spoke even to each other very little upon the subject ; for though the idea that he might become attached to Caroline was unavoidably suggested by his looks and manner , and by the distinguishing attention he had paid her ; yet they knew , that admiration sometimes is of a transient nature in the mind of a young man , and that there is a wide difference between liking a woman 's company , and thinking of marrying her . 
-- Nor could Mr. and Mrs. Percy forget , that Caroline had refused to quit them in adversity , or to leave her humble home , when Lady Jane Granville offered her all the pleasures of the metropolis , and with the patronage of fashion , all the means of success , all the chances of conquest and establishment , which would have been so eagerly desired , so instantly accepted by most girls of Caroline 's age , and of half her personal charms . 
Her parents , therefore , were resolved to spare no trouble , and no expense , which they could possibly afford now , when any opportunity offered , either for her temporary amusement , or permanent advantage . 
In consequence of these plans and reflections , Mrs. Falconer began her new system of operations , by writing that note full of superfluous civility to Mrs. Percy , with which Commissioner Falconer had been charged : -- the pressing Caroline to play Zara , or Marcia -- the leaving to her the choice of dresses and characters ; the assurance that Miss Georgiana Falconer would take the confidante 's part with pleasure , were all strokes of Mrs. Falconer 's policy . 
By these means she thought she could most effectually do away all suspicion of her own or her daughter 's jealousy of Miss Caroline Percy . 
Mrs. Falconer foresaw , that , in all probability , Caroline would decline acting ; but if she had accepted , Mrs. Falconer would have been sincerely pleased , confident , as she was , that Caroline 's inferiority to her Georgiana , who was an accomplished actress , would be conspicuously manifest . 
As soon as Mrs. Percy 's answer , and Caroline 's refusal , arrived , Mrs. Falconer went to her daughter Georgiana 's apartment , who was giving directions to her maid , Lydia Sharpe , about some part of Zara 's dress . 
`` Miss Caroline Percy -- Count Altenberg put it into my head -- he observed , that she would look the character remarkably well -- and I will write to her directly . '' 
-- Headstrong child , listen to me , or you will never see that day with Count Altenberg '' -- `` Do you mean , Ma'am , to ask Miss Caroline Percy to play Zara ? '' 
`` I only hope , Ma'am , you 'll put it in the play-bill ... or , if you do n't , I will -- Zara -- Miss Caroline Percy -- by particular desire of Count Altenberg . '' 
She never mentioned to Georgiana , that she had totally given up the scheme of marrying her to Count Altenberg , and that she was thoroughly convinced there was no chance of her winning him ; but , on the contrary , she represented to the young lady , that the Count had only a transient fancy for Miss Caroline Percy , which would never come to any serious proposal , unless it was opposed ; that in a short time they should go to Town , and the Count , of course , would return with Lord Oldborough ; then the game would be in her own hands , provided , in the mean time , Georgiana should conduct herself with prudence and temper , and let no creature see or suspect any sort of anxiety , for that would give such an advantage against her , and such a triumph to Caroline and her friends , who , as Mrs. Falconer said , were , no doubt , all on the watch to `` interpret , '' or misinterpret , `` motions , looks , and eyes '' -- `` My dear , '' concluded the mother , `` your play is to show yourself always easy and happy , whatever occurs -- occupied with other things , surrounded by other admirers , and encouraging them properly ... properly of course to pique the jealousy of your Count . '' 
`` -- I had no doubt at the time I wrote , '' continued Mrs. Falconer , coolly , `` I had no other idea but that Miss Caroline Percy would decline . '' 
`` Miss Caroline Percy ... sorry ... out of her power ! 
Every eye instantly turned upon the beautiful Caroline . 
She bore the gaze of public admiration with a blushing dignity , which interested every body in her favor . 
-- Count Altenberg , who had anxiously expected the moment of her arrival , was , however , upon his guard . 
After a few moments had elapsed , he could indulge himself in looking at Caroline unobserved , for the gaze of public admiration is as transient as it is eager . 
He was absolutely determined to see whether or not Caroline was capable of the mean passions , which had disgusted him in her rival . 
He reflected , that he had seen her only when she was triumphant ; and he was anxious to know how she would appear in different circumstances . 
Of her high intellectual endowments , he could not doubt , but temper is not always a blessing given to the fair , or even to the wise . 
It may seem strange that a gallant man should think of a beauty 's temper ; and , probably , if Count Altenberg had considered Caroline only as a beauty , he would not have troubled himself to make , on this point , any severe and dangerous scrutiny . 
Count Altenberg at this moment looked at Caroline , who , instead of joining in the laugh , showed by her countenance and manner the most good natured sympathy . 
Count Altenberg forgot to join in the cheering plaudits , he was so much charmed at that instant by Caroline 's smile . 
A party of ladies , among whom was Lady Frances Arlington , stood whispering so loud close to Caroline , that their voices were heard by her more distinctly than those of the actors . 
She endeavored not to hear them , till she perceived that they were trying to attract her notice . 
-- One of them gently touched her hair . 
-- She turned her head , and they pointed to Lady Frances , who stood half hid between the side-scenes , holding a little white dog in her arms . 
Caroline showed no curiosity , but the ladies thinking themselves sure of her approbation , were eager to explain -- `` Do n't look back , '' said Lady Frances -- `` Look at Zara . '' 
-- Caroline did as she was desired . 
They put their fingers upon their lips , and Caroline , her mother and sister , rejoiced that these ladies were at last silent . 
-- Caroline sprang forward -- caught the dog in her arms , and carried him off the stage . 
-- Caroline all the time , kept the little dog quiet by her caresses , -- and Count Altenberg did not hear one word of the repetition of Zara 's speech . 
-- At the beginning of the play , when the idea of trying Caroline 's temper had occurred to him , he had felt some anxiety lest all the high ideas he had formed , all the bright enchantment should vanish . 
-- In the first act , he had begun by joining timidly in the general applause of Zara , dreading lest Caroline should not be blessed with that temper , which could bear the praises of a rival `` with unwounded ear . '' 
But the Count applauded with more confidence in the second act , during the third was quite at his ease , and in the fifth , could not forgive himself for having supposed it possible , that Caroline could be liable to any of the foibles of her sex . 
-- For example , will any body have the goodness to tell me , '' said he , looking round , and fixing his look of appeal on Miss Caroline Percy ... `` how would you translate the famous ` Zaïre ! 
said Caroline , `` by ` Zara ! 
`` To our feelings it said a great deal just now , '' said Caroline , looking at Zara in a manner which was lost upon her feelings , but not upon Count Altenberg 's . 
Caroline seemed to wish to avoid being drawn forward to further discussion , but Mr. Clay repeated , in a tone of soft condescension -- `` Your silence flatters me with the hope , Ma'am , that we agree ? '' 
Caroline could not submit to this interpretation of her silence , and blushing , but without being disconcerted , she answered , that she had always heard , and believed , it was the test of true feeling , as of true wit , that it can be easily understood , and that it 's language is universal . 
Yet , even at this moment , which , as she conceived , was a moment of triumph , while she was encircled by adorers , while the voice of praise yet vibrated in her ears , she felt anguish at perceiving the serenity of her rival 's countenance , and however strange it may appear , actually envied Caroline for not being envious . 
-- At this period of their acquaintance with Count Altenberg , every circumstance which drew out his character , tastes , and opinions , was interesting to the Percy family in general , and in particular to Caroline . 
Mrs. Percy , Rosamond , and Caroline , escaped from the committee of dress , were now eagerly listening to this conversation . 
cried Caroline . 
There was so much life and energy in Caroline 's beautiful countenance , that French Clay was for a moment silenced by admiration . 
These lines came full into Caroline 's recollection whilst French Clay spoke : as he walked away , a pause ensued -- Caroline asked Count Altenberg , who seemed well acquainted with English literature , `` if he had ever read Scott 's Lay of the Last Minstrel ? '' 
Caroline blushed . 
Whenever they had approached the table , the young ladies had talked only of fashions in general ; and now , as Mrs. Percy and Caroline followed by Count Altenberg joined them , Mrs. Falconer put aside a volume of plays , containing `` the Lord of the Manor , & c. , '' and taking up another book , said something about the immortal bard to English Clay , who happened to be near her . 
for a translation , '' cried Mrs. Falconer , glad to turn the attention from , Georgiana -- `` Lady Frances ... Ladies , some of you ... Miss Percy , here 's my pencil . '' 
The ladies had all collected at the open windows , to see the departure of the Percys ; but Miss Georgiana Falconer could learn nothing from the manner in which the Count handed Caroline into the carriage . 
-- There was at first but one voice in praise of Caroline 's beauty and talents -- elegance , and simplicity of manner . 
I never should have guessed , if you had not told me , that Miss Caroline Percy was such a favorite of yours . 
-- Do you know now , so little penetration have I , I should have thought that you rather disliked her . '' 
-- `` I give you credit for your penetration -- entre nous , Miss Caroline Percy is no favorite of Georgiana 's . '' 
-- `` Georgiana does justice , I am sure , to Miss Percy 's merit and charms ; but the truth is , she does not like her , and Georgiana has too much frankness to conceal it ; and now come here , and under the rose I will tell you the reason . '' 
Georgiana , charmed to find this amiable mode of accounting for her dislike to Caroline , instantly pursued her mother 's hint , and frankly declared , that she never could conceal either her likings or dislikings -- that Miss Caroline Percy might have all the merit upon Earth , and she did not doubt but she had ; yet she never could forgive her for jilting Buckhurst -- no , never ! 
-- It might be unjust , but she owned that it was a prepossession she could not conquer . 
`` I 'd not swear for that , '' cried Lady Trant ; `` for , now I recollect , at Lady Angelica Headingham 's , what was it we heard , my dear Lady Kew , about her coquetting with that Mr. Barclay , who is now going to be married to Lady Mary Pembroke , you know ... '' `` Oh , yes , I did hear something , I recollect -- but , at the time , I never minded , because I did not know , then , who that Miss Caroline Percy was ... true , true , I recollect it now . 
-- And all , you know , we heard about her and Sir James Harcourt ... was there not something there ? 
... By all accounts , it is plain she is not the simple country beauty she looks . 
Mrs. Falconer , who had accomplished her own judicious purpose , of accounting for Georgiana 's dislike of Miss Caroline Percy , was now afraid that her dear friends would overdo the business ; she made many efforts to stop them , but once upon the scent of scandal , it was no easy matter to change the pursuit . 
Miss Georgiana Falconer was vexed , for she recollected , that Miss Caroline Percy had just been speaking of it with admiration . 
Lady Kew perseverved in her story -- `` Sir James Harcourt I know , who is the most polite creature in the whole world , and who never speaks an ill word of any body , I assure you , said of Miss Caroline Percy in my hearing ... what I shall not repeat . 
she may talk of Miss Percy 's beauty and abilities . 
... Very clever she is , I do n't dispute , but this I may say , that Mrs. Falconer must never praise her to me for simplicity of character . '' 
Caroline Percy 's manner is fascinating , because , you know , it is what one does not meet with every day in town . 
That and her great talents , which can make her whatever she pleases to be . 
... But I am greatly afraid she is not quite the ingenuous person she looks . '' 
Whilst he was turning over the leaves , Lady Trant went on , in her turn , `` With all her practice , or her simplicity , whichever it may be ... far be it from me to decide which ... I fancy she has met with her match , and has been disappointed in her turn . '' 
... But I am told she was very much in love ... the family would not hear of it -- the mother , especially , was averse . 
`` Yes , a pair of blue damask shoes as old as Edward the Fourth 's time ... with chains from the toe to the knee , you know ... or do you know , Count Altenberg ... Miss Percy was describing them ... She saw Colonel Hungerford put them on . 
-- It was with exquisite pain , that Count Altenberg had heard all that had been said of Caroline -- he did not give credit to half the insinuations ; he despised those who made them , he knew that some of the ladies spoke from envy , others from the mere love of scandal , but still , altogether , an impression unfavorable to Caroline , or rather unfavorable to his passion for Caroline , was left on his mind . 
-- The idea that she had been suspected , the certainty that she had been talked of , that she had even been named as one who had coquetted with many admirers -- the notion that she had been in love -- passionately in love -- all this took from the freshness , the virgin modesty , the dignity , the charm , with which she had appeared to his imagination , and without which she could not have touched his heart . 
Every thing that he had seen of Caroline had confirmed his first hope , and exalted his future expectation -- but , by what he had just heard , his imagination was checked in full career , suddenly , and painfully . 
-- He had not conceived it possible , that the breath of blame could approach such a character as Caroline 's -- he was struck with surprise , and shocked on hearing her name profaned by common scandal , attributed to different lovers , the victim of a disappointed passion , and the scorn of one of the most distinguished families in England . 
-- At the time he heard the whispers , which gave rise to them , he had been actually planning a letter to his father , declaring his attachment to Caroline -- he now resolved not to write . 
This determined him to go immediately to Mrs. Hungerford 's -- her son had been named as the person , to whom Caroline had been attached -- at Hungerford-Castle she had , it was said , seen Mr. Barclay , and Sir James Harcourt , with whom she had been accused of coquetting . 
The first sight of Mrs. Hungerford , the gracious dignity of her appearance and manners , the first five minutes ' conversation he had with her , decided him in the opinion , that common report had done her justice ; and raised in his mind extreme anxiety to know her opinion of Caroline . 
-- But , though he began the history of Zara , and of the play at Falconer-Court , for the express purpose of introducing the Percys , in speaking of the company who had been present , yet , conscious of some unusual emotion when he was going to pronounce that name , and fancying some meaning in Mrs. Hungerford 's great attention as he spoke , he mentioned almost every other guest , even the most insignificant , without speaking of Caroline , or of any of her family . 
-- Towards the conclusion of the letter , the writing changed to a small feminine hand -- and all India vanished from the view of Count Altenberg , for , as he turned the page , he saw the name of Caroline Percy -- `` I suppose I ought to stop here -- '' said he , offering the letter to Mrs. Hungerford ; -- `` No , '' -- she replied , `` the whole letter was at his service , they were only a few lines from her daughter Lady Elizabeth . '' 
These few lines mentioned Caroline Percy among the dear and intimate friends whom she regretted most in Europe , and to whom she sent a message expressive of the warmest affection and esteem . 
There was little probability that his wife should , if those circumstances were true , be Caroline 's most intimate friend . 
-- But I hope , '' continued Mrs. Hungerford , turning to Lady Mary , `` that my daughter will make me amends for losing a day of her company , by bringing me our dear Caroline to morrow . '' 
`` Is there a chance of Caroline 's coming to us ? '' 
`` Is there any hope of our seeing Miss Caroline Percy ? '' 
`` You are really a good creature , my dear , '' continued Mrs. Hungerford to Lady Mary , `` for being so anxious to have Caroline here -- many a niece might be jealous of my affection , for certainly I love her as well as if she were my own child . 
-- To morrow , Sir , '' said she , turning to Count Altenberg , `` I hope I shall have the pleasure to introduce you to this young friend of ours , I shall feel proud to show her to a foreigner , whom I wish to prepossess in favor of my countrywomen . '' 
The Count said , that he had already the honor of being introduced to Miss Caroline Percy -- that he had seen her frequently at Falconer-Court , and at her own home -- and that he was not surprised at the interest , which she excited at Hungerford-Castle . 
-- Count Altenberg showed the interest she had excited in his own mind , whilst he pronounced , in the most sober manner in his power , those few words . 
She was both too well bred in general , and too discreet on Caroline 's account , to take any notice of this circumstance . 
-- She passed immediately and easily to a different subject of conversation . 
The next day Mrs. Mortimer returned with Caroline . 
-- The Count saw the affection with which she was embraced by Mrs. Hungerford . 
The family had crowded to the door of the antichamber to receive her , so that Caroline , encompassed with friends , could not immediately see Count Altenberg , and he enjoyed these moments so exquisitely , that the idea which had previously engrossed all his soul , anxiety to see how she would look on meeting him thus unexpectedly , was absolutely forgotten . 
Mrs. Hungerford , with judicious , delicate kindness , forbore all attempts to display even those qualities and talents in Caroline , which she most loved and admired , certain that she might safely leave them to the discernment of her lover . 
Mrs. Mortimer felt as much joy and as much delicacy upon the subject as her mother showed ; for they loved Caroline , and were as anxious for her happiness , as if she had been their own sister or daughter , and felt almost as much scruple of praising or seeming to bring her forward upon any occasion . 
The grateful esteem of Mr. Barclay , now free from every feeling of passion , appearing , indeed undiminished even in the height of a passion for her friend ; the perfect confidence and affection evinced by the warm-hearted Lady Mary Pembroke for Caroline , all united and conspired to one and the same end : that which could not have been prepared or produced by any art or address , however consummate , was now the effect of plain truth , and the reward of real merit . 
Count Altenberg , in common with every man of sense and knowledge of the world , knew that it is in her own family , in domestic life , he should judge of a woman 's real disposition and temper -- and that from the manner of her friends towards her he can form an estimate of the past , and , consequently , the best augury of the future . 
In that near examination in domestic life , so dangerous to many women of the highest pretensions , Caroline shone superior . 
-- In consequence of this letter , a sudden change appeared in Count Altenberg -- he was grave and absent ; -- instead of seeking Caroline 's company and conversation as usual , he studiously avoided her , and when he did speak to her , his behaviour was so cold and reserved -- so unlike his natural or his former manner , that the difference struck not only Caroline herself , but Rosamond and Mrs. Percy , who were , at this time , at Hungerford-Castle . 
-- The accomplishments , good sense , and exalted sentiments of Count Altenberg had made an unusual impression on the mind of Caroline . 
She felt for him the first delightful sensations of love . 
His dignified manners , and that delicacy , which real merit always possesses , banished every fear of presumption on his part , and allowed her opportunity to see the development of his character , and to compare it with her own ideas of excellence . 
He had paid her few compliments , fewer than she had often received from gentlemen , who meant nothing by their flattery ; yet he had professed high admiration and esteem , and his attentions to her , unknown to himself , had passed the bounds of mere politeness , and the trifling appearance of common gallantry ; -- He had never declared his love , but involuntarily it had betrayed itself on several occasions . 
Insensibly Caroline was thus led to feel for him more than she dared to avow even to herself , when the sudden change in his manner awakened her from this delightful forgetfulness of every object that was unconnected with her new feelings , and suddenly arrested her steps as she seemed entering the paradise of love and hope . 
-- At night , when they were retiring to rest , and Caroline and Rosamond were in their mother 's room , Rosamond , unable longer to keep her prudent silence , gave vent to her indignation against Count Altenberg in general reflections against the fickleness of man . 
-- Caroline did not accede to these accusations . 
Rosamond , astonished and provoked , exclaimed , `` Is it possible that you are so blind , as not to see that Count Altenberg ... '' ... Rosamond stopped short , for she saw Caroline 's color change . 
-- She stood beside her mother motionless , and with her eyes fixed on the ground . 
beloved sister , '' cried Caroline , `` I have reason , too much reason , to blush -- and you will blush for me . '' 
I never saw Caroline so much agitated before . '' 
`` Sit down , my dear love , '' said her mother , tenderly taking Caroline 's hand , `` sit down and compose yourself . 
do not be so secure , your confidence in me abashes me still more , '' said Caroline , hiding her face , as she leaned on her mother 's shoulder . 
`` In common minds , '' replied Mrs. Percy , `` esteem and admiration may be far , very far , safely distant , from love ; but in such a mind as yours , Caroline , the step from perfect esteem to love is dangerously near -- scarcely perceptible . '' 
that is the very thing I desire for Caroline . 
Count Altenberg is all that we could wish for her , and ... '' `` Stop , '' cried Caroline , `` Oh , my dear sister ; as you wish me to be good and happy , name him to me no more -- for it can not be . '' 
-- Caroline sighed , and turning from her sister , as if she dreaded to listen to her , she repeated , -- `` No ; -- I will not flatter myself -- I see that it can not be -- I have observed the change in his manner . 
-- Caroline paused , and her mother and sister set her heart at ease on that point . '' 
-- I own I thought the change in his manner arose from ... Lady Florence Pembroke . 
... I dare say when he sees more of her ... she is very pretty , very pleasing , very elegant , and amiable no doubt , but surely , in comparison with Caroline . 
-- said Caroline . 
`` I am certain that there shall be none , '' said Caroline , -- `` Envy or jealousy shall never contaminate my mind . 
why did I open your eyes , Caroline ? 
said Caroline . 
`` Yes , I have great doubts , '' said Caroline . 
`` That last , '' cried Caroline -- `` I can never believe , '' -- She stopped , and blushed deeply -- `` What does my mother say ? '' 
added she , in a timid voice . 
`` My mother I am sure thought once that he loved Caroline ? 
`` Yes , my dear , '' answered Mrs. Percy , `` I have thought so -- And I am not yet convinced , that we were mistaken , -- but I entirely agree with Caroline , that this is a subject , upon which we ought not to let our thoughts dwell -- upon which she in particular ought not in propriety , in prudence , to allow herself to think . 
said Caroline -- `` But this is the first time I ever felt it difficult to practise what I know to be wise and right -- Hope ! 
... `` But why , Caroline , why mother , should she do this , '' expostulated Rosamond -- `` If she thinks , if you think that he loves her , if you do not believe that he has changed , if you do not believe that he is struck with a new face , why should Caroline go ? 
-- For Heaven 's sake , do not take her away , till you are sure , that it is necessary . '' 
`` I will be guided by her opinion , '' said Mrs. Percy , `` I can depend entirely on her own prudence . '' 
`` Indeed , I think it will be most prudent , that I should not indulge myself in staying longer , '' said Caroline -- `` From what I have seen of Count Altenberg , we have reason to think , that he acts in general from wise and good motives . 
-- What new duty can he have discovered -- No , no ; men are not so very apt in love matters to think of opposing duties , as women do -- Much more likely , that he has heard something to your disadvantage , Caroline , from the Falconers . 
`` If injurious representations have been made of me to him , '' replied Caroline , `` he will in time discover the falsehood of such report ; or , if he believe them without examination , he is not what I imagine him to be -- No -- I am convinced he has too noble a mind , too just an understanding , to be misled by calumny . '' 
-- Mrs. Percy declared she was decidedly of this opinion . 
`` The obstacle , whatever it may be , my dear mother , '' continued Caroline , with the earnest tone and expression of countenance of a person of strong mind , at once feeling and thinking deeply -- `` The difficulty , whatever it is , must be either such as time will obviate or increase ; the obstacle must be either conquerable or unconquerable ; if he love me , as I thought he did , if he have the energy of character I think he possesses , he will conquer it , if it can be conquered -- if it be unconquerable , what misery , what madness , to suffer my affections to be irrevocably engaged ! 
-- Then , in every point of view , Mother , surely it is best , that I should leave this ... dangerous place , '' said Caroline , smiling . 
`` My Love , '' said her mother , `` to us all things are trifles , compared with what it is right and becoming that you should do . 
`` The truth , '' -- replied Caroline , -- `` Mrs. Hungerford has ever treated me with so much kindness , has shown me so much affection and esteem , feels such a warm interest in all that concerns me , and is herself of so noble a character , that she commands my entire confidence -- And she shall have it without reserve . 
`` Mrs. Percy entirely approved of Caroline 's placing confidence in this excellent friend . '' 
The next morning , before Mrs. Hungerford had left her apartment , Mrs. Percy went to her , and explained the reasons , which induced Caroline to refuse herself the pleasure of prolonging her visit at Hungerford Castle . 
Mrs. Hungerford was touched by the confidence , which Caroline placed in her ; `` believe me , '' said she -- `` it is not misplaced -- I feel all it 's value -- And must I lose her ? 
-- With respect to Count Altenberg , Mrs. Hungerford said , that , from many observations she had made , she felt no doubt of his being strongly attached to Caroline . 
-- `` Their characters , their understandings , are suited to each other ; they have the same high views , the same magnanimity -- With one exception ... you must allow a mother 's partiality , to make an exception in favor of her own son , -- with one exception , Count Altenberg is the man of all others , to whom I could wish to see Caroline united -- I never till yesterday doubted that it would be -- But I was as much struck with the change in his manner , as you have been . 
-- I agree with Caroline , that some obstacle , probably of duty , has arisen -- and I hope ... But no , I will imitate her example , and as you tell me she forbids herself to hope , so will I -- if possible . 
-- At all events she raises herself , high as she was in my esteem , still higher by her present conduct . 
Tell her so , my dear Mrs. Percy -- you , her mother , may give this praise , without hurting her delicacy . 
Count Altenberg was to be one of this party , and he looked for a moment surprised and disappointed , when he found that Caroline was not going with them -- But he forbore to ask , why she did not ride , and endeavored to occupy himself solely in helping Mrs. Mortimer to mount her horse -- Rosamond was glad to perceive , that he did not well know what he was doing . 
-- Till this moment the sight of home , even after a short absence , had , on returning to it , always been delightful to Caroline ; but now , for the first time in her life , she was not sensible to this delight ; every object seemed to have lost it 's brightness . 
In the stillness of retirement , which she used to love , she felt something sad and lifeless . 
The favorite glade , which formerly she thought the very spot so beautifully described by Dryden , as the scene of his `` Lady in the bower ; '' even this she found had lost it 's charm . 
New to love , Caroline was not till now aware , that it throws a radiance upon every object , which , when passed away , seems to leave all nature changed . 
To banish recollections , which she knew that she ought not to indulge , she employed herself unremittingly . 
But her mind did not turn with it 's wonted energy to her occupations , nor was it acted upon by those small motives of ordinary life , by which it had formerly been excited . 
When reading , her thoughts would wander even from her favorite authors : Every subject they discussed would remind her of some conversation that had passed at Hungerford Castle ; some coincidence or difference of opinion would lead her to digress ; some observation more just or more striking ; some better expression , or some expression which pleased her better than the author 's , would occur , and the book was laid down . 
These digressions of fancy were yet more frequent , when she was endeavoring to fix her attention to drawing , needle-work , or to any other sedentary employment . 
Exercise she found useful . 
-- She spent more time than usual in planting and in gardening . 
One morning , soon after her return home , when she was alone and busy in her garden , she heard voices at a distance ; as they approached nearer , she thought she distinguished Mrs. Hungerford 's . 
She listened , and looked towards the path whence the voices had come . 
-- All was silent -- but , a minute afterwards , she saw Mrs. Hungerford coming through the narrow path in the thicket ; Caroline at first sprang forward to meet her -- Then stopped short , her heart beating violently -- she thought that , perhaps , Mrs. Hungerford was accompanied by Count Altenberg ; but Mrs. Hungerford was alone . 
Ashamed of the hope which had glanced across her mind , and of the sudden stop which had betrayed her thoughts , Caroline now went forward , blushing , yet with ingenuous dignity . 
continued Mrs. Hungerford , looking round , and talking with an air of playfulness , to give Caroline time to recover herself . 
-- said Caroline -- `` He is gone then . '' 
-- Caroline wished to ask where ? 
-- yet she continued silent -- and became extremely pale . 
Mrs. Hungerford , without taking any notice of her emotion , continued , and answered all the questions which Caroline wished to ask . 
-- Caroline revived . 
-- `` I hope so , '' said Caroline , timidly -- `` my mother , and Rosamond endeavored to reassure me on one point ... You have seen more since , and must therefore be better able to judge ... Count Altenberg has none of that presumption of manner , which puts a woman upon her guard against his inferences . 
-- `` I am satisfied -- quite satisfied , '' said Caroline , relieving her heart by a deep sigh , -- `` and , I thank you , my kind Mrs. Hungerford . 
From this time forward , Caroline never spoke more upon the subject , never mentioned the name of Count Altenberg . 
-- She exerted all the strong command she possessed over herself , to conquer the languor and indolence , to which she had found herself disposed . 
By using no concealment with her friends , by permitting no self-delusion , by having the courage to confess the first symptom of partiality of which she was conscious , Caroline prevented all danger , and put it out of her own power , to nourish a preference into a passion , which must ultimately have made herself and her friends unhappy . 
Beside the advantages which she derived from her literary tastes , and her habits of varying her occupations , she , at this time , found great resources in her warm and affectionate attachment to her own family . 
-- She had never yet arrived at that state of egoism , which marks the height of passion , when all interests and affections sink and vanish before one exclusive and tyrant sentiment . 
Miss Georgiana Falconer 's mortification at the Count 's leaving England was much alleviated , by finding that he had not been detained by the charms of Miss Caroline Percy , and she was almost consoled for losing the prize herself , by seeing that it had not been won by her rival . 
-- And if he could see me at this moment , he would pity me ... Oh , Caroline ! 
-- So Caroline 's wishes for Lady Mary Pembroke will be accomplished . 
-- Not Caroline , I hope ? '' 
-- It was Miss Percy 's warm affection for her sister Caroline , which first touched my heart . 
Caroline , grateful for the sympathy , which Rosamond had always shown her , took the warmest interest in this affair . 
-- Caroline was the most excellent , indulgent , yet safe confident ; and as a hearer , she was absolutely indefatigable ; Rosamond never found her too busy , too lazy , or too sleepy to listen to her -- late at night , early in the morning , or in the most hurried moment of the day , it was all the same , Caroline seemed to have nothing to do , but to hear , think , and feel for Rosamond . 
`` My dear Caroline , '' cried Rosamond , `` I must marry Mr. Temple at once , on purpose to pay you for your patience in listening to me . '' 
`` Why you know if I marry him next week , the week afterwards I shall accompany him on his embassy to that Court , where I shall see your Count Altenberg ... I beg your pardon ... Really , my dear Caroline , I did not think that name would crimson your face so deeply . 
Caroline turned the conversation , and spoke of Mr. Temple , reminding Rosamond , `` that it was absolutely necessary she should come to some decision , as the fortnight allowed by Lord Oldborough had now nearly elapsed . 
said Rosamond -- looking at Caroline -- `` not for my own sake , or his , my dear , but just that we may satisfy our curiosity about the person who must not be named . '' 
Now that there was an approaching possibility and probability of hearing of Count Altenberg , Caroline felt it extremely difficult to adhere to her resolution of never thinking of him , especially as her mind , which had been actively occupied and deeply interested in her sister 's concerns , was now left to return upon itself in all the leisure of retirement . 
-- Fortunately for her , about this time , she was again called upon for that sympathy , which she was ever ready to give to her friends . 
-- She received the following letter from Mrs. Hungerford . 
`` Come , my beloved Caroline , my dear young friend , friend of my family , and of all who are most near and dear to me ; come , and enjoy with me and them that happiness , which your judicious kindness long since foresaw , and your prudence promoted . 
Caroline and all Mrs. Hungerford 's Percys obeyed her summons with alacrity . 
-- As soon as the ceremony was over , and she had embraced and congratulated her niece , Mrs. Hungerford turned to Mrs. Percy , and in alow voice said , `` If it were not too much for one so happy as I am , so rich in blessings , to ask one blessing more , I should ask to be permitted to live to see the day when our dear Caroline ... '' -- Mrs. Hungerford pressed Mrs. Percy 's hand , but could say no more ; the tears rolled down her cheeks as she looked up to Heaven . 
-- Some minutes afterwards , following Caroline with her eyes , `` Look at her , Mr. Percy ! '' 
Lady Florence accompanied her sister ; and Mr. Hungerford , after parting from both her nieces , entreated that Caroline might be left with her . 
Caroline liked particularly to stay with Mrs. Hungerford at this time , when there was not any company at the Castle , no one but Mrs. Hungerford and her daughter , so that she had the full and quiet enjoyment of their society . 
-- At this time of her life , and in the state of her mind at this period , no society could have been more agreeable , soothing , and useful to Caroline , than that of such a friend as Mrs. Hungerford . 
-- Caroline felt , every day , increasing affection as well as admiration for Mrs. Hungerford , and found time pass delightfully in her company . 
Caroline found , that her mind was never passive or dormant in Mrs. Hungerford 's company , she was always excited to follow some train of thought , to discuss some interesting question , or to reflect upon some new idea . 
-- Caroline felt pleased , continually to find her own favorite opinions and hopes supported and confirmed by the experience and judgment of such a woman as Mrs. Hungerford ; and there was something gratifying to her , in being thus distinguished and preferred by one , who had read so much and thought so deeply . 
Mrs. Mortimer 's sprightly conversation and constant cheerfulness , joined to her fondness for her mother and for Caroline , and the peculiar charm of good breeding , added to all the rest , contributed now to make Caroline happy at Hungerford-Castle -- almost as happy as she had ever been in her life . 
-- As Mrs. Hungerford had heard nothing more of Count Altenberg , she wisely forbore to touch upon the subject , or ever to mention his name to Caroline ; and she saw , with satisfaction , the care with which her young friend turned her mind from every dangerous recollection . 
Something that pleases and interests you particularly , I see , '' said Mrs. Hungerford , not knowing what it was that Caroline was reading -- `` Show it me , my dear , I am sure I shall like it . '' 
Caroline , deeply blushing , gave her the paper , -- the moment Mrs. Hungerford saw the hand writing , she was sorry she had asked for it . 
The energetic warmth with which Mrs. Hungerford spoke relieved Caroline , as it seemed to justify the delight she had involuntarily expressed -- even to her own mind ; the sentiment for the individual seemed now enveloped in general approbation and benevolence . 
Mrs. Hungerford observed , that none of the common sentimental passages , either in poetry or novels , ever seemed to affect Caroline ; and to the romantic descriptions of love she was so indifferent , that it might have appeared to a common observer , as if she was , and ever would be , a stranger to the passion . 
In Caroline Mrs. Hungerford saw none of these capricious fancies ; but she perceived , that Count Altenberg was associated in Caroline 's mind strongly and justly with her highest ideas of excellence , and that it was not her imagination but her reason , which gave him the exalted place he held in her opinion . 
Mrs. Mortimer , though as fond of Caroline as her mother was , either did not penetrate so deeply into her character , or willingly flattered herself , that a scheme which she had formed might succeed -- A scheme of marrying Caroline to Captain Hungerford , her younger brother . 
`` Think no more of it , my dear , '' said Mrs. Hungerford -- `` I once formed a wish of this sort for Caroline -- her own prudence ... But -- Think no more of it , much as I should wish to have her for my daughter , I know it can not be . '' 
`` I would lay my life upon it , that my brother Frederick will be charmed with her ; she is all that I have heard him describe as most amiable , and her style of beauty exactly what will enchant him -- He will lose his heart to her , as sure as he has a heart -- and a noble heart it is . '' 
`` If you think so , '' said Mrs. Hungerford , `` I should be sorry that Caroline were here , when he returns to us . '' 
`` Trust to him , '' said Mrs. Mortimer , smiling , `` Frederick will make his own way -- in such a heart as Caroline 's . '' 
-- Mrs. Hungerford was silent -- `` Of Count Altenberg we hear nothing , '' continued Mrs. Mortimer , `` and if he should not return to this country , we may hope that , in time , my brother may deserve and obtain the place , which the faithless Count will have forfeited in her affections . '' 
Mrs. Hungerford was persuaded , on the contrary , that if Caroline did not marry Count Altenberg , she would never marry any other man . 
But before Captain Hungerford arrived , Caroline was obliged to leave her friends at Hungerford-Castle . 
A letter from her brother Erasmus informed her , that poor Lady Jane Granville was ill of a nervous fever , that she had no companion , no one to attend her but a maid-servant , and that she was much in want of some judicious friend , who could raise her spirits and tranquillize her mind , which was in a state of continual agitation about her law-suit . 
Caroline , remembering Lady Jane 's former kindness , thought this a fit opportunity to show her gratitude ; and happy as she was with her friends at Hungerford-Castle , she hesitated not a moment to sacrifice her own pleasure -- She withstood all Mrs. Mortimer 's urgent entreaties to stay `` one week , only one week longer '' -- Her father and mother approved of Caroline 's determination , and her brother Alfred carried her to London . 
In these days people travel with so much safety , ease , and celerity , that heroines have little chance of adventures on the road ; and a journey is now so common a thing , that , as Rosamond observed , the most brilliant imagination has no hope of having wonders to relate -- To Rosamond 's mortification , Caroline and her brother reached London without any event having occurred better worth recording than the loss of an umbrella . 
They drove into town when it was nearly dark , just before the lamps were lighted ; Caroline , therefore , had little satisfaction from the first view of the metropolis -- She found Lady Jane Granville in a small lodging in Clarges Street -- The room dark -- a smell of smoke -- the tea equipage prepared -- Lady Jane lying on a shabby-looking sofa -- drops and a smelling bottle on a little table beside her . 
She raised herself as Caroline entered , looked half pleased , half ashamed to see her , and stretching out her hand , said , in a complaining voice : `` Ah ! 
my dear Caroline , are you really come ? 
... Sadly changed you find -- and every thing about me -- Sit down , my dear -- Keppel ... do let us have tea as soon as you can '' -- `` As soon as ever Eustace comes in , my lady , '' answered Keppel , peevishly -- `` In the mean time , for Heaven 's sake , allow us a little more light ... I can not live without light -- Come nearer to me , my dear Caroline , and tell me , How did you leave all our friends at the Hills ? '' 
Whilst Caroline was answering her Ladyship , more candles were brought , and Lady Jane moved them on the table , till she threw the light full on Caroline 's face . 
-- One would not think , Alfred , she had been buried all this time in the country -- Ah ! 
-- `` Dr. Percy is not come yet , '' resumed she . 
`` This is his usual hour -- and I wrote a note to tell him that he would meet his sister Caroline to night . '' 
In all her Ladyship said , in every look and motion , there was the same nervous hurry and inquietude . 
While this was undecided , her imagination vacillated between the horror of neglected poverty , and the hopes of recovering her former splendor and consideration -- The lawsuit was not to be decided for some weeks , and Caroline saw , that all that could be done in the meantime was as much as possible to sooth and amuse her patient ; however tiresome and difficult the task , she went through it with the utmost cheerfulness and sweetness of temper -- Day after day she passed alone with Lady Jane , hearing her complaints , bodily and mental , and listening to the eternally repeated history of her lawsuit . 
-- But Caroline 's patience was ensured by a sense of gratitude , which , in her , was not a sentimental phrase , but a strong principle of action , a motive for long endurance , still more difficult than active exertion . 
One half hour in the day , however , she was sure of being happy -- the half hour when her brother Erasmus paid his visit -- Of Alfred she saw little , for he was so much engaged with business , that had accumulated during his absence from town , that a few minutes now and then were all he could possibly spare from his professional duties . 
-- Mr. Temple called upon Caroline -- she was surprised to see him , for she thought he had been on his way to the continent ; but he told her , that difficulties had occurred , chiefly through the manoeuvres of Cunningham Falconer , and that he did not know when there would be an end of these -- that Lord Oldborough was glad of the delay at present , because he wanted Mr. Temple 's assistance , as the other secretary had been taken ill , and his Lordship had not yet fixed upon a confidential person to supply his place -- Of course , in these circumstances , Mr. Temple was so much occupied , that Caroline saw very little of him ; and she experienced what thousands have experienced , that , however people may wish to meet in great towns , it is frequently impracticable , from small difficulties as to time , distance , and connexions . 
-- Of Mr. Gresham Caroline had hoped that she should see a great deal -- her brother , Erasmus , had long since introduced him to Lady Jane Granville , and notwithstanding his being a merchant , her Ladyship liked him . 
He was as much disposed as ever to be friendly to the whole Percy family ; and the moment he heard of Caroline 's being in town , he hastened to see her , and showed all his former affectionate regard in his countenance and manner . 
The whole story was now told to Caroline , and , briefly , was this -- After Old Panton 's rage against Dr. Percy , in consequence of the suspicion that his daughter was in love with him , after the strange wig scene , and the high words that followed , had driven Erasmus from the house ; Constance went to her father , and intent upon doing justice to Erasmus , at whatever hazard to herself , protested , that he had not been the cause of her refusal of Lord Roadster . 
Of this , indeed , he seldom needed any additional circumstances to complete the conviction on any occasion -- During the remainder of his life he continued obstinate in his error -- `` If she likes any body else , why ca n't the girl name him ? 
`` If Rosamond had heard the sigh , which closed this speech , '' thought Caroline , `` and if she had seen the simplicity and delicacy of Mr. Gresham 's generosity on this occasion , she would have reproached herself for refusing him , and would almost have reasoned herself into the belief , that she had done very wrong not to marry him -- But this belief would only , ... could only , have lasted till she should see Mr. Temple again -- So that , upon the whole , it was best for poor Mr. Gresham , that she knew nothing of the matter . '' 
-- All things being arranged thus in the kindest and most convenient manner by this excellent Mr. Gresham , and the day being fixed for the marriage of Constance and Mr. Henry -- Caroline was asked to be bride 's - maid , and the honor of Lady Jane Granville 's company was requested -- It is inconceivable how much importance Lady Jane attached to the idea of her accepting or refusing this request , and the quantity she talked about it was wonderful ! 
-- Every five minutes for two hours after the first reading of Mr. Gresham 's note , she took it up , laid it down , and argued the matter pro and con to Caroline . 
-- A long and loud knock at the door -- came to Caroline 's relief -- It was repeated with imperious impatience -- `` Who is it , my dear -- look out of the window , but do n't let yourself be seen . '' 
Caroline did not know any of the fashionable equipages , which to Lady Jane appeared a great want of common sense , or rather a great defect in her education -- Upon this occasion however , she thought she recollected the livery to be Mrs. Falconer 's . 
-- `` It might very possibly be so , '' Caroline allowed . 
cried Lady Jane , throwing down the paper , `` Mrs. Falconer has accomplished that match at last , and has got one of her daughters well off her hands -- the ugly one too -- Upon my word she is amazingly clever -- But , after all , the man has a horrid temper , and a very bad character -- Now it is over , my dear Caroline , I must tell you , that long ago , before I was so well aware of what sort of man he was , I had formed the plan of marrying him to you , and so uniting the two branches , and bringing the estate into your family -- But , we have often reason to rejoice , that our best concerted schemes do n't succeed -- I give Mrs. Falconer joy -- For worlds I would not have such a man married to any relation or friend of mine -- Oh , if I recover my fortune , Caroline , I have hopes ! '' 
-- He was a man who said less , and did more for his friends , as Caroline observed , `` than almost any person she knew . '' 
On seeing his gallery of paintings , she had noticed some beautiful miniatures ; he now brought all those which she had admired , and begged to leave them with her during his absence , that she might at her leisure copy any of them she liked . 
He knew she painted in miniature , for he had long ago , when at the Hills , seen her copy of M. de Tourville 's picture of Euphrosyne . 
-- `` If , '' said Mr. Gresham , observing that Caroline scrupled to take charge of so many precious pictures -- `` If you are too proud to receive from me the slightest kindness without a return , I am willing to put myself under an obligation to you . 
-- `` Oh , Rosamond , '' thought Caroline , `` if you had heard that ! 
Lady Jane started up , clasped her hands , -- embraced Alfred , -- embraced Caroline -- returned thanks to Heaven -- again and again , in broken sentences , tried to express her gratitude to Alfred -- A flood of tears came to her relief . 
-- Caroline , who sympathized with the pleasure felt by both , was , perhaps , as happy as either . 
Caroline , when she saw Lady Jane restored to her strength , and in excellent spirits , preparing to take possession of a handsome house in Cavendish Square , thought she might now be spared to return to her own family . 
Caroline felt extremely unwilling to offend one whom she had obliged , and one who really showed such anxiety for her happiness . 
`` I know , my dear Lady Jane , '' said she , smiling , `` that if I stay with you , you will form a hundred kind schemes for my establishment ; but forgive me when I tell you , that it is in the certainty that they will none of them be accomplished , that I consent to accept your Ladyship 's invitation . '' 
-- `` I 've changed my mind , '' said Caroline playfully . 
-- `` To be entirely candid then , '' said Caroline , `` I must , my dear Lady Jane , if you will give me leave , tell you more . '' 
-- Caroline thought , that however , Lady Jane and she might differ on some points , her Ladyship 's anxiety to promote her happiness in the way she thought most advantageous deserved not only her gratitude , but her confidence . 
-- Before Caroline has passed a month in fashionable society , provided she has a fashionable admirer , we shall hear no more of this Count Altenberg . '' 
-- `` Well , my dear , '' said she , holding out her hand to Caroline , -- `` I will give you my word , I will , to the best of my ability , comply with all your conditions . 
BeholdLady Jane Granville reinstated in her fortune , occupying a fine house , in a fashionable Square , with suitable equipage and establishment ; carriages rolling to her door ; tickets crowding her servant 's hands ; an influx , an affluence of friends , and congratulations such as quite astonished Caroline . 
thought she . 
Warm in her affection to Caroline , she was eager to do every thing that could contribute to her pleasure and advantage . 
-- The dressing , the producing her young friend was her prime object . 
Caroline had neither the pretensions of a provincial wit , nor of a country beauty ; happily for her she had not formed high expectations of pleasure , any hope of producing effect , or even sensation , upon her first appearance in the fashionable world . 
As she said in her letters to her friends at home , nothing could be more dull , or tiresome , than the first experience of a young lady 's introduction into life ; nothing , as she assured Rosamond , could be less like the reality , than the delightful representations in novels , where every day produces new scenes , new adventures , and new characters . 
In reality , Caroline 's beauty had not passed so completely unobserved as her modesty and inexperience imagined . 
She did not know the signs of the times . 
-- On her first entrance into a public room , eyes turned upon her , the eyes of mothers with apprehension , -- of daughters , with envy . 
Some gentleman , an abstract admirer of beauty , perhaps , asked the honor of her hand -- to dance . 
-- A few , indeed , went farther , and swore that she was a fine girl , prophesied that she would take , and declared they would be d -- d if they would not think of her , if they could afford it . 
-- From their prophecies or their oaths nothing ensued , and even the civilities and compliments she received from Lady Jane 's particular friends and acquaintance , though in a more polite style , were equally unmeaning and unproductive . 
Unluckily for Caroline , her brother Alfred was about this time obliged to leave town . 
Dr. Percy was so continually employed , that she could scarcely have a few minutes in a week of his company , now that Lady Jane 's health no longer required his professional attendance . 
Caroline , who had always been used to domestic society and conversation , was thus compelled to live completely in public , without the pleasures of home , and without the amusement young people generally enjoy in company , when they are with those of their own age , to whom they can communicate their thoughts . 
Lady Jane Granville was so much afraid of Caroline 's not appearing fashionable , that she continually cautioned her against expressing her natural feelings at the sight of any thing new and surprising , or at the perception of the tiresome or ridiculous . 
-- Her Ladyship would never permit her protégée to ask the name of any person in public places , or at private parties -- because not to know certain people `` argues yourself unknown . '' 
`` I 'll tell you who every body is , when we go home '' -- When she was at home , Lady Jane was generally too much tired to explain or to comprehend the description of these nameless bodies . 
And even when her Ladyship was able to satisfy her curiosity , Caroline was apt to mistake afterwards the titles and histories of the personages , and by the misnomers of which she was guilty provoked Lady Jane past endurance -- Whether it was from want of natural genius in the scholar , or interest in the study , or from the teacher 's thus unphilosophically separating the name and the idea , it is certain , that Caroline made but slow progress in acquiring her fashionable nomenclature . 
-- She was nearly in despair at her own want of memory , when fortunately , a new instructress fell in her way , who was delighted with her ignorance , and desired nothing better than to tell her who was who ; -- in every private party and public place , to point out the ridiculous or notorious , and at the moment the figures were passing , whether they heard or not , to relate anecdotes characteristic and illustrative . 
Her Ladyship having quarrelled with Miss Georgiana Falconer , hated to go out with Mrs. Falconer , hated still more to stay at home with the old tapestry-working Duchess her aunt , and was delighted to have Lady Jane Granville to take her every where -- She cared little what any person thought of herself , much less what they thought of Caroline -- therefore free from all the delicacies and anxieties of Lady Jane 's friendship and systems -- Lady Frances , though from different premises , coming to the same conclusion -- agreed , that thinking of Caroline 's advantages -- was stuff ! 
-- and that all she had to do was to amuse herself in town . 
-- Caroline was the most convenient companion to go out with , for she never crossed her Ladyship about partners , or places , never vied with her for admiration , or seemed to mind her flirtations , but quietly suffering her to draw off all the fashionable beaux , whom Lady Jane stationed upon duty -- she let Lady Frances Arlington talk , or dance , to her heart 's content , and was satisfied often to sit still and be silent . 
The variety of words and ideas , facts and remarks , which her lively and practised companion poured into her mind , Caroline was left to class for herself , to generalise , and to make her own conclusions -- Now she had means of amusement : she took pleasure in observing all that was going on , and she knew something of the characters and motives of the actors in such different scenes . 
As a speculator , she was particularly struck by the eagerness of all the players , at their different games of love , interest , ar ambition . 
And in various sets of company , she was diverted by observing how each thought themselves the whole world -- Here a party of young ladies and gentlemen , practising , morning , noon , and night , cotillon steps for their quadrille -- And while they are dancing the quadrille , jockey gentlemen ranged against the wall in the ball-room , talking of their horses -- grave wigs and snuff-boxes in a corner settling the fate of Europe , proving that they were , are , or ought to be behind the scenes . 
Caroline had as yet seen but few of the literary candidates for celebrity ; only those privileged few , who , combining the pretensions of rank and talent , had a natural right to be in certain circles , or those who , uniting superior address , had risen or forced their way into fine company -- Added to these were two or three , who were invited to parties as being the wonder and show of the season -- Persons whom the pride of rank found it gratifying to have at command , and who afforded to them a most happy relief from the dullness of their habitual existence . 
Caroline , though pitying the exhibitors , whenever she met any of this description , had great curiosity to see more of literary society . 
`` Yes , my dear , I did promise to take you to Lady Angelica Headingham 's , and Lady Spilsbury 's , but there 's time enough -- not yet ... not till I have established you in a higher society ... Not for your advantage to get among the blue-stockings -- the blue rubs off -- and the least shade might ruin you with ... some people -- If you were married , I should introduce you to that set with pleasure ... for they entertain me vastly , and it is a great privation to me this winter -- A long fast -- But even this abstinence from wit I can endure for your sake , my dear Caroline -- you are my first object , -- If you would take the bel esprit line decidedly . 
But Lady Frances Arlington , who thought only of her own chance of amusement , seconded Caroline 's wish to see the literary set -- Nothing could be more stupid , her Ladyship said , than running round always in the same circle -- for her part , she loved to see clever odd people , -- And though her auntduchess would not let her go to Lady Spilsbury 's , yet Lady Frances was sure , that , with Lady Jane Granville for her chaperon , she could get a passport for Lady Angelica Headingham 's , `` because Lady Angelica is a sort of cousin , I ca n't tell you how many times removed , but just as many as will serve my present purpose -- A connexion quite near enough to prove her fashionable , and respectable , and all that -- So , my dear Lady Jane -- I 'll ask leave , '' concluded Lady Frances , `` and we will go next conversazione day . '' 
-- No -- Lady Jane was firm to what she believed to be for Caroline 's interest , and she refused to take Caroline into that set , and therefore declined the honor of chaperoning her Ladyship to Lady Angelica Headingham 's . 
When I am dying with impatience to see my cousin make herself ridiculous , as I hear she does more and more every day with that Baron Wilhelmberg -- Wilhelmberg , I said , not Altenberg -- Miss Caroline Percy need not have turned her head so quickly . 
said Caroline . 
said Caroline . 
`` Now your Ladyship is not serious , I am sure , '' said Caroline . 
that , for the mere pleasure of drawing a caricature , you would let your own cousin expose herself with an adventurer , '' said Caroline . 
So far , Lady Frances had , with address , touched her foible for her purpose ; but Lady Jane 's affection for Caroline strengthened her against the temptation . 
She was persuaded , that it would be a disadvantage to Caroline to go to this conversazione . 
-- She would not upon any account have Miss Percy be seen in the blue-stocking set at present -- she had her reasons . 
-- To this resolution her Ladyship adhered , though Lady Frances Arlington , pertinacious to accomplish any purpose she took into her fancy , returned morning after morning to the charge . 
`` Never , -- my dear Lady Frances , till Miss Caroline Percy is married '' -- said Lady Jane -- `` I have my own reasons . '' 
`` Then I wish Miss Caroline Percy was to be married to morrow -- I have my own reasons . 
But , after all , tell me , is there any the least chance of Miss Percy 's being married ? '' 
`` Not the least chance , '' said Caroline . 
`` That is her own fault , '' said Lady Jane , looking mortified and displeased . 
But in the evening she declared , that she would not take Lady Frances Arlington out with her any more , that her Ladyship 's spirits were too much for her , -- `` Besides , '' my dear Caroline , `` when she is with you , I never hear you speak a word , you leave it entirely to her Ladyship . 
-- Caroline admitted , that Lady Frances was thoughtless and giddy , but she hoped not incurably selfish , as Lady Jane now seemed to suppose . 
Caroline endeavored to excuse her Ladyship , by saying , that , by all accounts , she had been educated in a way that must make her selfish . 
Caroline , who always saw the best side of characters , said something in favor of Lady Frances , and pleaded her freedom from art and dissimulation . 
-- `` My dear Caroline , she is not half so free from dissimulation , as you are from envy and jealousy . 
-- She is always in your way , and you never see it . 
-- I ca n't bear to hear you defend her , when I know she would and does sacrifice you ; at any time and all times , to her own amusement . 
But she shall not stand in your light -- for you are a generous , unsuspicious creature . 
Returning from the party this evening -- a party where they met Lord William , who had sat beside Caroline at supper , Lady Jane began to reproach her with having been unusually reserved and silent . 
Caroline said she was not conscious of this . 
-- '' Caroline assented fully to the truth of this remark ; assured Lady Jane , that she had not intentionally hung back , or been reserved ; that she had no affectation of this sort . 
`` Then , Ma'am , I hope it will be observed too , '' said Caroline , smiling , `` that the gentlemen do not talk to me . '' 
Caroline was perfectly sensible of this -- she knew she was deficient in the sort of conversation of the moment , requisite for fine company and public places . 
-- My dear , you must condescend to talk without saying any thing -- And you must bear to hear and say the same words a hundred times over -- and another thing , my dear Caroline , I wish you would cure yourself of looking fatigued . 
-- You will never be thought agreeable , unless you can endure , without showing that you are tired , the most stupid people extant -- '' Caroline smiled , and said , she recollected her father 's telling her , `` that the Prince de Ligne , the most agreeable man of his day , declared , that his secret depended not on his wit or talents for conversation , but on his power of concealing the ennui he felt in stupid company . '' 
-- It was dull , but Caroline did her best to look happy , and exerted herself to talk to please Lady Jane , who , from her card-table , from time to time , looked at her , nodded , and smiled . 
-- And I hear Miss Caroline Percy is very agreeable . 
The next morning , Caroline had stolen away from visitors , and quietly in her own room was endeavoring to proceed in her copy of the miniature for Mr. Gresham , when Lady Jane came into her apartment , with a letter and it 's cover in her hand . 
-- `` A letter , in which you , Caroline , are deeply concerned . '' 
A sudden hope darted across Caroline 's imagination , and illuminated her countenance . 
-- As suddenly it vanished , when she saw on the cover of the letter , no foreign post mark , no foreign hand -- but a hand unknown to her . 
-- she asked -- with difficulty commanding her voice , to articulate the words . 
`` Only a proposal for you , my dear , '' said Lady Jane , smiling -- `` Not a proposal for which you need blush -- as you 'll see -- if you 'll read -- '' But observing that Caroline was not at this moment capable of reading , -- without seeming to notice the tremor of her hand -- and that she was holding the letter upside down before her eyes , Lady Jane , with kind politeness passed on to the picture , at which her young friend had been at work , and stooping to examine the miniature with her glass , made some observations on the painting , and gave Caroline time to recover . 
-- Nor did her Ladyship look up till Caroline exclaimed , `` John Clay ! 
-- Surprises are generally ill-judged -- and always ill-bred -- Acquit me , I beseech you , of all but thoughtlessness , '' -- said Lady Jane , sitting down by Caroline , and kindly taking her hand -- `` I hope you know I am not Mrs. Falconer . '' 
`` I do , indeed , '' said Caroline , pressing her hand , `` I feel all your kindness , all your politeness . '' 
-- `` I hope you can not apprehend that , for the sake of his seven or ten thousand , whatever he has per annum , I should press such a match upon you , Caroline . 
`` Thank you , my dear Lady Jane , '' cried Caroline , embracing her with warm gratitude . 
''' -- `` I believe I had no feeling , but pure surprise , '' said Caroline . 
Properly the thing was done -- The letter folded , not awkwardly , was sealed and shut , Caroline delighted with Lady Jane , and Lady Jane delighted with herself . 
Caroline laughed , but said she was glad Lady Jane was not one of those , who count refusals as so many proofs of a young lady 's merit ; for her own part , she acknowledged she was inclined to think , that they were sometimes proofs rather of coquetry and duplicity . 
-- The conversation went on , till her Ladyship and Caroline came to a complete opposition of opinion on a principle , which , though it was only stated in general , and in the abstract , her Ladyship defended with an urgency , and Caroline resisted with a steadiness , which are seldom shown about any merely speculative point , unless there is some secret apprehension of their being soon reduced to practice . 
Caroline thought this would be using the man ill . 
`` But without refusing , '' Caroline said , that `` a gentleman might be led to perceive when he was not likely to be accepted , and thus would be saved the pain and humiliation of a rejected proposal . '' 
`` Caroline , on these subjects you must trust to one who knows the world , to tell you the opinion of the world . 
These were heavy charges , Caroline felt , but she thought , that , when not deserved , they could be borne better than self-reproaches for the want of candor and truth . 
Caroline made a distinction between real delicacy and punctilio . 
But the greater virtue should not be sacrificed to the less -- Truth and sincerity , Caroline thought , must be classed among the highest virtues of woman , as well as of man , and she hoped they were perfectly consistent with the utmost feminine modesty and delicacy . 
She asked whether , after all , the plea of delicacy and punctilio was not sometimes used to conceal the real motives -- Perhaps ladies , in pretending to be too delicate to see a gentleman 's sentiments , were often , in fact , gratifying their own vanity , and urging him to that declaration , which was to complete the female triumph . 
Lady Jane grew angry -- but fearing lest Caroline should perceive , that she had some particular object in view ... doubtful whether Caroline knew , or did not know , her aim -- and further having a secret hope , that , like , other young ladies who support fine sentiments about love and generosity in conversation , she might , when it came to the test , forget them , her Ladyship urged her opinion no further . 
Indeed she candidly acknowledged , that much might be said on Caroline 's side of the question -- and there the matter ended . 
The object , that Lady Jane had in view , was to prevent Caroline from discouraging by premature candor a passion , which she saw rising in the heart of a young nobleman . 
Since Miss Caroline Percy 's arrival , and appearance in town , Lady Jane had , to do her justice , preserved with his Lordship exactly the same even tenor of conduct ; whatever her wishes might be , she had too much proper pride to compromise her own , or her young friend 's dignity . 
-- When he became acquainted with Miss Caroline Percy , he soon found , that to her all this appeared , and by her was justly valued . 
-- His Lordship never was wakened to the sense of it 's being necessary to stir , till Miss Caroline Percy , by some strong indication , such as putting away her drawing , and the books , or by plainly saying , `` We must go out now , '' -- made it manifest to him , that he must depart . 
-- For this Caroline was regularly reproved afterwards by Lady Jane -- but she never found , that it gave Lord William any offence ; nor did she for some time observe , that it caused him much disquietude . 
-- This was not with Caroline a mere commonplace phrase . 
-- She believed this to be true , -- and at the time she believed it , she was right . 
Whatever signs of esteem or regard he could obtain from Miss Caroline Percy , he knew to be perfectly sincere ; if he was ever loved by her , he knew it would be for his own sake , and of the constancy of her affection , if once obtained , the whole tenor of her character and conduct gave him the most secure pledge . 
-- Miss Percy 's education , manners , talents , and beauty , were all such as perfectly suited , and would do honor , and would grace the highest rank of life . 
She had no fortune , -- but that was of no consequence to him -- he was likely to have a princely income -- he had no debts , he had at present all that satisfied his wishes , and that could enable him to live married , as well as single , in a manner that suited his station . 
-- And his reason and passion now both determined on that choice , just about the time when English Clay proposed for Caroline , and when the conversation about declarations and refusals had passed between her and Lady Jane . 
-- That conversation , instead of changing or weakening the opinions Caroline then expressed , had confirmed her in her own sentiments , by drawing out more fully the strength of the reasons , and the honorable nature of the feelings , on which they were founded . 
-- Some slight circumstances , such as she could scarcely state in words , occurred about this time , which first gave her the idea , that Lord William -- felt for her more than esteem . 
-- The tender interest he showed one day when she had a slight indisposition , -- the extreme alarm he expressed one night , when there happened an embarrassment between their carriages at the door of the opera-house , by which Lady Jane 's vis-à-vis , was nearly overturned , -- an alarm much greater than Caroline thought the occasion required , was succeeded by anger against his coachman , so much more violent and vehement , than the error or offence justified , or than his Lordship had ever before been seen to show ... These things , which in a man of gallantry might mean nothing , but to show his politeness , from Lord William -- seemed indicative of something more . 
-- Caroline began to see , that the friend might become a lover , and now , for the first time , questioned her own heart . 
-- She thought highly of Lord William 's abilities and character -- She saw , as she had once said to Lady Jane , `` signs which convinced her , that this volcano covered with snow , and often enveloped in clouds , would at some time burst forth in torrents of fire . '' 
-- Little indication as Lord William now showed to common observers of being or of becoming an orator , Caroline perceived in him the soul of oratory ; and she foresaw , that on some great occasion , from some great motive , he would at once vanquish his timidity , and burst forth upon the senate . 
She felt convinced that -- whether eloquent or silent , speaking , or acting , in public or private life , Lord William -- would in every situation , in every circumstance of trial , fill and sustain the character of an upright , honorable , enlightened English nobleman . 
-- Notwithstanding that Caroline thought thus highly of him , Count Altenberg , in her opinion , far surpassed him in the qualities they both possessed , and excelled in many , in which Lord William was deficient -- in manner especially ; and manner goes a great way in Love , even with people of the best understanding . 
He also had had the advantage of finding Caroline 's mind disenganged -- he had cultivated her society in the country , where he had time and opportunity to develope his own character and hers . 
-- In one word , he had made the first impression on Caroline 's heart -- and such an impression , once made on a heart like hers , can not be easily effaced . 
Though there seemed little chance of his returning to claim his place in her affections , though she had made the most laudable efforts to banish him from her recollection , yet `` en pensant qu'il faut qu'on oublie , on se souvient . '' 
-- And now she found , that not only all others compared with him were inferior , and indifferent to her , but that any , whom she was forced to put in comparison and competition with Count Altenberg , immediately sunk in her opinion . 
Thus distinctly knowing her own mind , Caroline was however still in doubt as to Lord William 's , and afraid of mistaking the nature of his sentiments . 
She well remembered Lady Jane 's cautions ; and though she was fully resolved to spare by her candor the suspense and pain , which coquetry might create and prolong , yet it was necessary to be certain that she read aright , and therefore to wait for something more decisive , by which to interpret his meaning . 
One night Lady Jane and Caroline were to be at a party . 
His eye caught Caroline as she passed , and his color changed . 
-- By degrees Lord William worked his way towards Caroline -- No , not towards Caroline , but to Lady Jane Granville . 
-- The company near her were talking of a proposal , which a gentleman had lately made for a celebrated beauty -- His suit had been rejected . 
-- Lady Jane Granville supported warmly the same side of the question , which she had taken in a similar conversation with Caroline . 
Miss Percy was appealed to for her opinion , `` Would it not be strange indeed , if a lady were to reject a gentleman before she was asked ? '' 
Lord William with increasing anxiety listened , but dared not look at Caroline , who with becoming modesty , but with firmness in what she believed to be right , answered , `` that if a woman saw that a gentleman loved her , and felt that she could not return his attachment , she might , without any rude or premature rejection , simply by a certain ease of manner , which every man of sense knows how to interpret , mark the difference between esteem and tenderer sentiments ; and might , by convincing him that there was no chance of his obtaining any further interest in her heart , prevent his ever having the pain of a decided refusal . '' 
-- The company moved different ways , but his Lordship continued fixed near Caroline -- At last the attention of all near him was happily diverted and drawn away from him by the appearance of some new and distinguished person -- He seized the moment , and summoned courage sufficient to address some slight question to Caroline -- She answered him with an ease of manner , which he felt to be unfavorable to his wishes . 
Mrs. Crabstock came up , and Lady Jane , with wit at will , kept the pattern lady in play by an opportunely recollected tale of scandal ; with ears delighted , eyes rivetted , stood Mrs. Crabstock , while Lord William , again relieved from the fear of observation , breathed once more , and , partly recovering his senses through the mist that hung over him , looked at Caroline , in hopes of drawing some encouraging omen from her countenance . 
-- He had come to this party , determined to say something that should explain to her his sentiments . 
-- He thought he could speak to her better in a crowd than alone . 
`` Miss Percy , I never was so inclined in all my life to quarrel with ease of manner in any body as in you . '' 
-- If I thought ... '' He stopped short -- he felt as if his life hung upon a thread -- as if the first look , the first sound of her voice , the next word spoken , must decide his fate . 
`` And I think it is impossible , that , with your Lordship 's penetration , you should mistake mine , '' said Caroline . 
There was an ingenuous sweetness in her look and voice , a fear of giving pain , yet a resolution to be sincere . 
-- Caroline heard from him a deep sigh . 
-- With great and painful emotion , in the most calm voice , she could command , but in the kindest tone , she added , `` For the sentiments of regard and esteem your Lordship has expressed for me , believe me , I am truly grateful . 
... '' Mrs. Crabstock moved toward them , and Caroline paused . 
cried Lady Jane Granville , `` we are to be at the Duchess of Greenwich 's ball ; Caroline , my dear -- time for us to move . 
Lady Jane looked back at Caroline , who was a little behind her . 
They had now reached the bottom of the stairs ; a shawl of Lady Jane 's was not to be found , and while the servants were searching for it , she and Caroline , followed by Lord William , went into one of the supper rooms , which was open . 
`` I would stay , if I could see any thing to keep me , '' said Lord William -- impelled , contrary to his better judgment , to appeal once more to Caroline 's countenance . 
-- Lady Jane , turning back , saw his Lordship 's look ; and now , convinced that Caroline was to blame for all , reproached herself for misinterpreting his words and manner . 
`` Well , my Lord , '' cried she , `` you will not be in such haste to set out for Tunbridge I am sure , as to go before you hear from me in the morning . 
His Lordship bowed , and said he should do himself the honor of waiting her Ladyship 's commands . 
She passed on quickly towards the hall . 
Lord William offered his arm to Caroline . 
... I must speak to you , Miss Percy ... and have but a moment ... '' Caroline walked more slowly . 
`` No , '' said Caroline , in a tremulous voice , yet , for his sake , as well as for the sake of her own consistency , trying to suppress emotion , which she thought he might misinterpret . 
-- He stopped -- he was silent -- they came within view of the servants -- he walked quietly to the carriage -- assisted her into it , pressed her hand -- `` Farewell -- for ever , '' he said in a low voice , and let it go . 
-- The Duchess of Greenwich 's , or home , Caroline ? '' 
home , if I may choose , '' said Caroline . 
And the moment the glass was up , `` Caroline , my dear , tell me this instant , what is all this between you and Lord William ? 
Caroline could not , she was in tears . 
-- If you have said any thing irrevocable , and without consulting me , I never ... never will forgive you , Caroline . 
Caroline tried to obey her Ladyship . 
`` I have said the truth -- I have done -- I hope what I ought , '' said Caroline , -- `` but I have given great pain . 
... '' Lady Jane now perceiving by her voice that she was in sorrow , spoke no more in anger , but , checking herself , and changing her tone , said , `` It is not irremediable , my dear . 
Caroline sighed -- `` Alas ! 
my dear Caroline ! 
`` Now , Caroline , take care -- remember your countenance is open to me -- if not your heart . '' 
`` Both , both are open to you , my dear friend , '' cried Caroline . 
Caroline related every thing that had passed ; and Lady Jane , when she had finished , said , `` A couple of children ! 
`` It can not be done '' -- said Caroline . 
`` Children should not say must , '' cried Lady Jane , in a playful tone ; for never did she feel in more delightful spirits than this moment , when all her hopes for Caroline , as she thought , were realized ; `` and to complete ` the pleasing history , ' no obstacle remained , '' she said , `` but the Chinese mother-of-pearl curtain of etiquette to be withdrawn , by a dexterous delicate hand , from between Shuey-Ping-Sin and her lover . '' 
cried Caroline . 
`` My dear Lady Jane , '' cried Caroline , stopping her Ladyship 's hand -- `` I am in earnest . '' 
`` So , then , '' cried Lady Jane , impatiently -- `` You will not trust me -- You will not open your heart to me , Caroline . '' 
Caroline shook her head -- `` It will not -- I can not -- '' `` And you wo n't do this , when I ask it as a favor for my friend , my particular friend ? '' 
`` Then I 'll never ask any thing else while I live from you , Miss Percy , '' cried Lady Jane , rising and throwing her pen from her -- `` You are resolved to throw your happiness from you -- do so -- Wish your happiness ! 
-- yes , I have wished it anxiously -- ardently -- but now I have done -- You are determined to be perverse and philosophical -- Good night to you '' -- Lady Jane snatched up her candle , and , in haste , retired -- Caroline , sensible that all her Ladyship 's anger at this moment arose from warm affection , was the more sorry to have occasioned it , and to feel that she could not , by yielding , allay it instantly -- - A sleepless night . 
-- Early in the morning , Keppel , half - dressed and not half awake , came , with her Ladyship 's love and begged to speak a word to Miss Percy . 
repeated Caroline , as she went to Lady Jane 's apartment -- `` how kind she is ! '' 
Caroline kissed her affectionately . 
`` And let these tears , my dearest Caroline , '' continued Lady Jane , `` be converted into tears of joy -- for my sake -- for your whole family -- for your own sake , my sweet girl , be advised , and do n't throw away your happiness for life -- Here 's a note from Lord William -- he waits my commands -- that 's all -- Let me only desire to see him '' -- `` On my account ? 
I can not , '' said Caroline -- the tears streaming down her face , though she spoke calmly . 
`` But if he be not so to me , '' said Caroline . 
`` That can only be because ... you are conscious of the cause , Caroline ... It is your own fault . '' 
`` And therefore I said , that I felt I had no reason to be proud , '' said Caroline . 
`` Too probable '' -- said Caroline . 
`` And will you , you Caroline Percy , like Lady Angelica Headingham , leave your heart at the mercy of a foreign adventurer ? '' 
`` Oh stop , Ma'am , '' cried Caroline , putting her hand before Lady Jane 's mouth -- `` do n't say that word , any thing else I could bear -- But if you knew him ... education , character , manners ... no , you would not be so unjust -- '' `` You know ... you told me you were sensible you ought not to indulge such a weakness , Caroline . '' 
`` I did -- I am sensible of it ... Oh you see I am ... and my best ... my very best have I done to drive him from my memory -- And never , till I was forced to make this comparison , did I recollect ... did I feel ... -- Weak I may be , '' said Caroline , changing from great agitation to perfect decision -- `` but wicked I will not be -- I will never marry one man , and love another -- My own happiness if I sacrifice , mine be the consequence -- but I will never injure the happiness of another -- Do not , Madam , keep that noble heart , this excellent Lord William in suspense -- What are your commands ? '' 
It must be done , thought Caroline , sooner or later -- `` My compliments , Keppel to Lord William , '' said Lady Jane , `` I have no commands to trouble him with ... Stay , I must find something ... that parcel for Mrs. Baggot , Tunbridge -- I must write ... I can not write . '' 
With great difficulty , in the agitation of her mind and hand , Lady Jane wrote a few lines , and holding the note up , looked at Caroline -- a last appeal -- in vain . 
-- `` Take it , Keppel -- I 'm sorry Lord William 's servant has been kept waiting '' -- cried her Ladyship , and suddenly closed the curtain . 
-- Caroline retired softly , hoping that Lady Jane might sleep , and sleep off her anger -- But no -- The morning past -- the day past -- and the sun went down upon her wrath . 
-- Caroline , alone with her , endured a terrible tête à tête . 
Lady Jane never spoke , Caroline tried all she could , by affectionate kindness of look and voice , and by contrite gentleness , to sooth her perturbed spirit . 
Lady Jane 's anger admitted of no alleviation , her disappointment increased the more she reflected , and the more she thought of what others would think , if they could know it -- And that they did not know , might never know it ... -LRB- for Lady Jane was too honorable to betray Lord William 's secret -RRB- ... was an additional mortification -- It was not till after ninety-six hours , that Caroline perceived in her Ladyship any change for the better . 
The first favorable symptom was her giving vent to her natural feelings in the following broken sentences -- `` After all my pains ! 
-- Then there would have been some credit at least -- and some comfort to me -- But now , at the end of the campaign , just where we were before -- The season over , and au bout du compte , under Lady Jane Granville 's chaperonage , the beautiful Miss Caroline Percy has received one proposal and a quarter ! 
No less an event than Alfred 's marriage , no event calling less imperatively upon her feelings , could have recovered Lady Jane 's sympathy for Caroline . 
But Alfred Percy , who had been the restorer of her fortune , her friend in adversity , what pain it would give him to find her , at the moment when he might expect her congratulations , quarrelling with his sister -- that sister , too , who had left her home , where she was so happy , and Hungerford Castle , where she was adored , on purpose to tend Lady Jane in sickness and obscurity ! 
-- Without being put exactly into these words , or , perhaps , into any words , thoughts such as these , with feelings of gratitude and affection , revived for Caroline in Lady Jane 's mind the moment she heard of Alfred 's intended marriage . 
-- It was the first time , that her Ladyship had said my dear to Caroline since the day of the fatal refusal . 
Caroline was touched by this word of reconciliation -- and the tears it brought into her eyes completely overcame Lady Jane , -- who hastily wiped her own . 
-- `` So , my dear Caroline , ... where were we ? 
-- '' And , Alfred , when you see your sister Caroline , tell her that I am not in one sense such a wretch . 
... Quite as ... she thinks me . 
-- But tell her that I am yet a greater wretch ... infinitely more miserable than she , I hope , can conceive -- beyond redemption -- beyond endurance miserable . '' 
She judiciously , maliciously , or accidentally began to talk of the proposal , which she had heard a near relation of hers had not long since made to a near relation of Mr. Alfred Percy 's -- Mr. Clay of Clay-Hall , her nephew , had proposed for Mr. Alfred 's sister , Miss Caroline Percy . 
-- She was really sorry the match was not to take place , for she had heard a very high character of the young lady in every way , and her nephew was rich enough to do without fortune -- Not but what that would be very acceptable to all men -- especially young men , who are now mostly all for money instead of all for love -- Except in the case of very first rate extraordinary beauty , which therefore making a woman a prey just as much one as the other , might be deemed a misfortune as great , though hardly quite , Mrs. Buckhurst said , as she had found a great fortune in her own particular case . 
The involution of meaning in these sentences rendering it not easy to be understood , the Dean stood it pretty well , only stirring his coffee , and observing that it was cold ; but when his lady went on to a string of interrogatories about Miss Caroline Percy -- on the color of her eyes and hair -- size of her mouth and nose -- requiring in short a complete full length portrait of the young lady , poor Buckhurst set down his cup , and pleading business in his study , left the field open to Alfred . 
-- Alfred begged his sister Caroline from Lady Jane , as he had already obtained his father 's and mother 's consent . 
Lady Jane was really fond of Caroline 's company , and had forgiven her , as well as she could ; yet her Ladyship had no longer a hope of being of use to her , and felt that even if any other offer were to occur , and -- none such as had been made -- could ever more be expected -- it would lead only to fresh disappointment and altercation ; therefore she , with the less reluctance , relinquished Caroline altogether . 
-- Caroline 's new sister had been , from the time they were first acquainted , her chosen friend , and she rejoiced in seeing all her hopes for her brother 's happiness accomplished by this marriage . 
-- This was the domestic use of accomplishments , which Caroline loved , to which she had always been accustomed , and in joining in her new sister 's occupations , and endeavors to make Alfred 's evenings pass pleasantly , she felt at once as much at home , as if she had been in the country -- for the mind is it 's own place , and domestic happiness may be naturalized in a capital city . 
-- At her brother 's house , Caroline had an opportunity of seeing a society that was new to her , that of the professional men of the first eminence , both in law and medicine , the men of science , and of literature , with whom Alfred and Erasmus had been for years assiduously cultivating acquaintance . 
Caroline now saw the literary and scientific world to the best advantage . 
Thus Caroline found herself placed at once au courant du jour , as to every thing literary and scientific , by means of her two brothers and their friends . 
-- The first news , the first hints of discoveries , inventions , and literary projects , she heard from time to time discussed . 
Those men of talents , who she had heard were to be seen at conversaziones , or of whom she had had a glimpse in fine society , now appeared in a new point of view , and to the best advantage ; without those pretensions and rivalships , with which they sometimes are afflicted in public ; or those affectations and singularities , which they often are supposed to assume , to obtain notoriety among persons inferior to them in intellect , and superior in fashion . 
-- All this , from the conversation which she now heard behind the scenes , Caroline had an opportunity of seeing , and she was much edified and amused ; beside the pleasure of studying celebrated characters , and persons of eminent merit , at their ease and at her own , Caroline had now opportunities of seeing most of those objects of rational curiosity , which with Lady Jane Granville had been prohibited , as -- mauvais ton . 
Among the gentlemen of learning , talents , and eminence in Alfred 's own profession , whom Caroline had the honor of seeing at her brother 's , were Mr. Friend , the friend of his early years at the bar ; and that great luminary , who in a higher orbit had cheered and guided him in his ascent . 
-- It was heartfelt pleasure to Caroline , to see the manner in which her brother was considered and treated by his inferiors , equals , and superiors in his profession -- for each , in his different way , gave testimony to Alfred 's talents , candor , or generosity . 
It was impossible for a woman like Caroline , not to be struck with his superiority of intellect , good breeding , and character ; and equally impossible that her merit , even had it not been recommended by so much beauty , should escape his penetration and benevolence . 
He saw the genuine affection she bore her brother , and was pleased to gratify her by the praises of Alfred . 
-- As Caroline once , in speaking of him , said , `` Common compliments , compared to praise from him , are as common coin , compared to a medal struck and appropriated for the occasion . '' 
Alfred had just returned fatigued from the courts , and was resting himself , in conversation with his wife and Caroline . 
-- Look , '' cried her Ladyship , drawing out of her ridicule a caricature -- which she put into Caroline 's hand , and , whilst she was looking at it , Lady Frances went on speaking rapidly . 
`` I know , Sir , '' said Lady Frances ... `` So , Caroline , you wo n't see the likeness . 
-- Good bye , Caroline . 
-- Caroline , what do you think Rosamond would have thought of all this ? '' 
-- But Alfred did not think it possible , that Lady Trant could be the forger of these letters , because he had seen some of her Ladyship 's notes of invitation to Caroline , and they were written in a wretched cramped hand . 
Alfred went with Caroline to Lady Jane Granville 's , to meet Lady Frances Arlington ; he entered into conversation , and by degrees brought her to his point , playing all the time with her curiosity , and humoring her childishness , while he carried on his cross-examination . 
-- Caroline took advantage of the opportunity of returning home with her brother Alfred , when he went to the country to prepare Clermont-Park for the reception of Lord Oldborough . 
And now she saw her home again with more than wonted delight . 
Every thing animate and inanimate seemed to smile upon her , every heart rejoiced at her return , and she enjoyed equally the pleasure of loving , and of being beloved by such friends . 
-- She had been amused and admired during her residence in London , but a life of dissipation she had always thought , and now she was convinced from experience , could never suit her taste or character . 
She would immediately have resumed her former occupations , if Rosamond would have permitted , but Rosamond took entire possession of her at every moment when her father or mother had not claimed their prior right to hear and to be heard . 
`` Caroline , my dear , do n't flatter yourself that you shall be left in peace ... See ! 
-- she is sitting down to write a letter , as if she had not been away from us these six months ... You must write to Lady Jane Granville ! 
Much as she loved talking in general , Rosamond now so far preferred the pleasure of hearing , that , with her eyes fixed on Caroline , her countenance varying with every variety of Caroline 's expression , she sat perfectly silent all the time her sister spoke . 
-- But , during the pauses of narrative , when the pause lasted more than a minute , she would say , `` Go on , my dear Caroline , go on . 
-- `` Tell him that I know his first wish will be to come to show me , that it is the man , not the minister , for whom he had a regard . 
Rosamond eagerly seconded this proposal , and whispered , `` Caroline 's bower . '' 
This bower of Caroline 's , this favorite spot , Rosamond , during her sister 's absence , had taken delight in ornamenting , and it did credit as much to her taste , as to her kindness . 
After `` the Reliques of Ancient Poetry `` had been sufficiently admired , Rosamond and Caroline mentioned two modern compositions , both by the same author , each exquisite in it 's different style of poetry , one beautiful , the other sublime . 
-- Caroline 's `` the Mariners of England ! '' 
Caroline fixed the attention of the company on the flag , which has `` Brav 'd a thousand years the battle and the breeze , '' when suddenly her own attention seemed to be distracted by some object in the glen below . 
She endeavored to go on , but her voice faltered , her color changed . 
-- To Mr. Percy , to Mrs. Percy , to Rosamond , to each he spoke , before he said one word to Caroline . 
That he was not married she was certain -- for that look said he loved her -- and her confidence in his honor was secure . 
Whatever had delayed his return , or had been mysterious in his conduct , she felt convinced , that he had never been to blame . 
-- And on his part did he read as distinctly the truth in her countenance ? 
With deference the most marked , mingled with dignity , tenderness , and passion , he approached Caroline . 
He was too delicate , too well-bred , to distress her by distinguishing her more particularly , but as he took the seat , which she left for him beside her mother , the open and serene expression of her eye , with the soft sound of her voice , in the few words she answered to what he said , were enough to set his heart at ease . 
Rosamond had the humanity , and Caroline the discretion , to accompany him in his walk . 
-- Miss Caroline Percy . '' 
Mr. and Mrs. Percy both acknowledged , that they thought Count Altenberg had shown some preference for Caroline ; but as he had never declared his attachment , they had not felt themselves justified in inferring more from his attentions , than his general good opinion . 
All that his son said of his attachment to Caroline , of the certainty of it 's permanence , and of it 's being essential to the happiness of his life , the father heard , but as the common language of every youth in love . 
-- As to the rest they must refer him to Caroline herself . '' 
Mr. Percy said , with a grave voice , but with a smile , from which the Count augured well , `` that even for the most advantageous , and in his opinion the most desirable connexion , he would not influence his daughter 's inclinations , Caroline must decide . '' 
-- Mr. Percy advised , that the appeal to Caroline should be postponed till the next morning . 
-- The Count was impatient -- but Mrs. Percy , who knew that her daughter , though she had commanded her feelings , had been much agitated by his unexpected appearance , prevailed upon him to defer speaking to her till the succeeding day , that she might have an opportunity of relating to her all that they had just heard from the Count ; and thus , she said , no time would be lost in preparing Caroline to do him justice . 
-- -- `` And there must be a great trial for us both -- prepared at this moment '' -- said Mrs. Percy -- `` No joy unmixed with sorrow -- At this moment , whilst you hold her to your heart ... We must remember , that Caroline will soon be no longer amongst us -- Rosamond we shall not lose -- But , Caroline ! '' 
-- Caroline turned away , and burst into tears . 
`` The first tears her mother ever made her shed '' -- said Rosamond -- `` the very first from childhood to this hour ! '' 
`` Listen to me , my Caroline , '' said Mrs. Percy , sitting down beside her on the bank on which she had sunk -- `` Listen to me , my child ... '' `` Listen , Caroline ! '' 
`` Caroline ! 
-- It must be so -- It is the order of nature -- We are fond , but not selfish , parents -- If your happiness be secured by the sacrifice , we can part with you -- And when the time comes -- here is your mother , will bear it better , perhaps , than I shall -- with all my boast of fortitude -- better , certainly , '' continued Mr. Percy , smiling -- `` better , infinitely , than Rosamond , who , at this instant , thinks us all fools , and stands there , in her secret thoughts convinced , Caroline , that you will do whatever you please with Count Altenberg , make him give up power , prince , country , and live where and how you choose . '' 
`` That was just what I was thinking , '' said Rosamond -- `` And you will see , that ` What in my secret soul was understood , His lips shall utter , and his deeds make good ' `` Yes , father , '' continued Rosamond , `` you will see , that Caroline will make the Count say and do whatever she pleases -- she will make him sacrifice power , fortune , country , all for love . '' 
`` No , '' said Caroline -- `` I never would ask , never would accept of such sacrifices -- he is bound by honor and duty to his prince and his country , and if I become his wife , his honor becomes mine , his duty mine -- However great the sacrifices required , I must be prepared to make them -- or -- resolve ... '' To prevent Caroline from dwelling on the alternative , Rosamond turned quickly to her father and mother , and requested to know , if they might hear the result of their long conference with Count Altenberg -- During the repetition of this narrative , Rosamond 's eagerness of attention and solicitude were such , that any one ... any one but Mr. Temple , might have imagined , it was to the history of her own lover she was listening -- She was charmed to find her prophecies , as she said , accomplished ; and that the Count justified all that she had ever believed of his constancy . 
Rosamond forgot , and Caroline never reminded her , that her belief and her prophecies had varied considerably , at different times , during his absence , and had , some days , been diametrically opposite to what she now fancied they had ever steadily continued . 
Even of late -- very lately -- in her pity for poor Lord William -- Rosamond , though she would not now allow it , was rather inclined to think Lady Jane Granville in the right , and was disposed to suspect the absent lover in the wrong -- Caroline , conscious that she had always done him justice , and rejoiced that she had not mistaken his sentiments , was confirmed now by facts in her favorable opinion of the Count , and her partiality was heightened by the grateful conviction of the steadiness and strength of his attachment . 
The next day the Count , with all the persuasive tenderness and energy of truth and love , pleaded his own cause , and was heard by Caroline with a modest , dignified , ingenuous sensibility , which increased his passion -- Whilst she acknowledged how high he stood in her esteem , she did not attempt to conceal the impression he had made on her heart ; yet he saw the unaffected anguish she felt at the idea of quitting her parents , her sister , all her family , friends , home , country -- Saw that she dreaded to yield her heart to the promises , the hopes , of the passion , which must , at last , require from her such sacrifices -- Sacrifices which , had she contemplated in the commencement of her acquaintauce , she said , would have prevented her ever daring to love , but she became attached before she ever thought of these , before she had ever considered Count Altenberg as a man , whom it was probable she should marry -- The very circumstance of his being a foreigner , a traveller , with whom it was likely she would have but a transient acquaintance , had thrown her heart off it 's guard ; and when she was first wakened to the perception of her own partiality , it was in circumstances , when there seemed little chance of his even wishing to separate her from her friends -- As long as the hope of being united to him was faint and distant , so was the fear of the sacrifices that union might demand -- but now , the hope , the fear , the certainty , at once pressed on her heart with the most agitating urgency . 
The Count soothed , and as far as possible , relieved her mind , by the assurance , that though his duty to his Prince and to his father , though all his public and private connexions and interests obliged him to reside for some time in Germany , yet that he could occasionally visit England , that he should seize every opportunity of returning to a country , that he preferred to all others ; and , for his own sake , he should cultivate the friendship of her family , as each individual was , in different ways , suited to his taste , and stood high in his esteem . 
He might hope , that he had obtained a portion of their regard , and that , with the strong inducements Caroline could hold out to them , they would be prevailed upon , in their turn , to visit the Continent , so that , though separated by distance , she would not be lost to her family ; and , perhaps , she might , upon the whole , enjoy more of the society of her friends , though at longer intervals of time , than married daughters often do , who live in the same country with their parents . 
Caroline listened with fond anxiety to these hopes ; she was willing to believe in promises , which she was convinced were made with entire sincerity ; but she dreaded , that Count Altenberg 's situation and duties , as a statesman and a minister , would render it impossible that they should be fulfilled . 
-- And a life at court , a life of representation , to say no worse of it ... would be to her most irksome . '' 
Nothing but the extraordinary merit , joined to the extraordinary powers of pleasing , which Count Altenberg possessed , nothing in short but love , ... which appeared more reasonable , and became stronger the more it was combated , could have vanquished these objections , and have prevailed with Caroline to make these sacrifices -- However , when her affections had been wrought to this point , when her resolution was once determined , she never afterwards tormented the man , to whom she was attached , with wavering doubts and scruples ; but , disdaining affectation and caprice , what she gave was doubly given , from being graciously bestowed ; and the value of what she sacrificed was doubly felt -- from the dignity and unostentatious generosity , with which that sacrifice was made . 
-- Count Altenberg 's promise to his Prince obliged him to return by an appointed time ; Caroline wished that time had been more distant ; she would have delighted in spending the spring time of love in the midst of those who had formed till now all the happiness of her life , with her parents , to whom she owed every thing , to whom her gratitude was as warm , as strong , as her affection -- with her beloved sister , who had sympathized so tenderly in all her sorrow , and who ardently wished to have some time allowed to enjoy her happiness . 
-- Caroline felt all this , but she felt too deeply to display feeling , -- sensible of what the duty and honor of Count Altenberg demanded , she made no hesitation , -- asked for no delay . 
-- The first letters , that were written to announce her intended marriage , were to Mrs. Hungerford , and to Lady Jane Granville -- And it may be recorded as a fact rather unusual , that Caroline was so fortunate as to satisfy all her friends ; not to offend one of her relations , by telling any too soon , or too late , of her intentions . 
In fact she made no secret , no mystery , where none was required by good sense or propriety . 
Nor did she communicate under a strict injunction of secresy to twenty friends , who were afterwards each to be angry with the other for having , or not having told that of which they were forbidden to speak . 
-- The order of precedency in Caroline 's confidential communications was approved by all the parties concerned . 
Mrs. Hungerford was at Pembroke , with her nieces , when she received Caroline 's letter ; her answer was as follows , `` MY DEAR CHILD , I am ten years younger since I read your letter , therefore do not be surprised at the quickness of my motions -- I shall be with you at the Hills , in Town , or wherever you are , as soon as it is possible , after you let me know when and where I can embrace you and our dear Count . 
-- At the marriage of my niece , Lady Mary Barclay , your mother will remember , that I prayed to Heaven I might live to see my beloved Caroline united to the man of her choice -- I am grateful that this blessing , this completion of all my earthly hopes and happiness , has been granted to me , M. Elizabeth Hungerford . '' 
Excepting always the secrets of which she was possessed before marriage , which do not go into the common stock , if she be a woman of honor -- So I am safe with you , Caroline ; and any erroneous opinion I might have formed , or any hasty expressions I may have let drop , about a certain Count , you will bury in oblivion , and never let me see you look even , as if you recollected to have heard them . 
`` I am impatient , my dear Caroline , to see your Count Altenberg . 
Indulge me perhaps , my dear Caroline , for the last time , with your company , of which , believe me , I have , though a woman of the world , sense and feeling sufficient , fully to appreciate the value -- Yours -LRB- at all events -RRB- , ever and affectionately , J. Granville . '' 
Caroline and all her family had pleasure in showing Lady Jane , that they felt grateful for her kindness . 
-- Mr. Temple obtained permission from Lord Oldborough , to accompany the Percys to Town ; and it was settled , that Rosamond and Caroline should be married on the same day . 
Lady Jane Granville was peculiarly happy , in finding that Mr. Percy agreed with her in opinion , that marriages ought to be publickly solemnized ; and rejoiced , that , when Caroline should be led to the altar by the man of her choice , she would feel that choice sanctioned by the approbation of her assembled family and friends -- Lady Jane justly observed , that it was advantageous to mark as strongly as possible the difference between marriages with consent of friends , and clandestine unions , which from their very nature must always be as private as possible . 
-- Now that Rosamond 's marriage was postponed , she claimed first right to be her sister 's bridemaid , Lady Florence Pembroke , Mrs. Hungeford 's niece , had made her request , and obtained Caroline 's promise to be the second -- and these were all that Caroline desired to have -- but Lady Jane Granville evidently wished for the honor and glory of Lady Frances Arlington for a third , because she was niece to the Duke of Greenwich ; and besides , as Lady Jane pleaded , `` Though a little selfish , she really would have been generous , if she had not been spoiled -- to be sure , she cared in general for no one but herself , ... yet she absolutely showed particular interest about Caroline -- Besides , her Ladyship had set her heart upon the matter , and never would forgive a disappointment of a fancy . '' 
We regret that we can not gratify some of our courteous readers with a detailed account of the marriage of Caroline and Count Altenberg , with a description of the wedding-dresses , or a list of the company , who , after the ceremony , partook of an elegant collation at her Ladyship 's house in Cavendish Square . 
After all their other friends had made their congratulations , had taken leave of Caroline , and had departed , Mrs. Hungerford and Mrs. Mortimer still lingered . 
-- Farewell again and again , my beloved Caroline , may every . 
... '' Tears spoke the rest -- turning from Caroline , she leaned on Count Altenberg 's arm ; as he conducted her to her carriage , she could only say , `` You are a happy man , Count Altenberg . 
Count Altenberg was more touched by this strong affection for Caroline , than he could have been by any congratulatory compliments to himself . 
-- Caroline , flushed crimson to the very temples one instant , and pale the next , commanded with the utmost effort her emotion . 
Rosamond , unable to repress hers , clung to her sister , weeping -- Caroline 's lips quivered with a vain attempt to speak -- she could only embrace Rosamond repeatedly , and then her mother -- in silence . 
-- She stood motionless , for she had not power to withdraw her cold hand from her mother . 
-- Her father pressed her to his bosom -- blessed her -- and then drawing her arm within his , led her to her husband . 
Caroline stopped , and took leave of each . 
-- She was able , though with difficulty , to speak , and she thanked them for all the services and kindness she had received from them from childhood to this hour . 
-- Then her father led her on to the carriage . 
if it was not for such a husband as Count Altenberg , I never , never could bear this separation , thought Caroline , as she took leave of her father . 
Her foot was now on the step of the carriage , into which Count Altenberg was handing her ; when , turning to look once more at her father , two men rudely crossed between them , and an instant afterwards , she saw one of these lay his hand on her father 's shoulder , and heard him say the words , `` Arrest ! 
Caroline sprang from the step of the carriage , Count Altenberg opened a way for her between the sheriff 's officers into the house . 
`` Do not be alarmed , my dear Caroline . 
-- There is no cause , '' said her father , in a calm voice . 
Mr. Percy thanked the Count -- and Caroline , by her look , thanked him most tenderly ; but her father firmly said , that he would not involve any of his friends in his difficulties . 
Then turning to Caroline , he said , `` You know the worst now , my dear daughter ; from your strength of mind I expect , in all circumstances , resolution . 
-- Caroline , with the anguish of divided duty and affection , looked from her father to her husband . 
that I should separate you at this moment from your father , Caroline , '' said the Count . 
-- Stay with your father , dearest Caroline ! 
Caroline , as thought she had not been a bride , prepared to accompany her father to prison . 
Mr. Percy , his wife , and daughter Caroline , then quitted her Ladyship 's hospitable and elegant mansion , and were conducted to a very different abode in the King 's - Bench . 
-- Mr. and Mrs. Percy fixed upon a tolerably clean , but very small room , which they preferred , because it had a closet large enough to contain a bed for Caroline . 
As soon as they were in possession of these rooms , Caroline began to arrange the little furniture they contained , in such a manner , as to make her father and mother as comfortable as circumstances would admit . 
-- Caroline , now recollecting every circumstance , rose with a heavy heart , but appeared before her parents with a cheerful countenance . 
-- Whilst she made breakfast , -LRB- Oh how unlike the breakfast of the preceding morning ! 
-- -RRB- she began to calculate when she could hear from Count Altenberg . 
-- Count Altenberg , whom she scarcely yet ventured to call her husband . 
Caroline opening one , to read it to her father , involuntarily looked first for the foreign news , but her eye was caught by a splendid account of her own marriage , and of Count Altenberg 's setting out for the Continent . 
This prevented her from reading loud for some moments . 
The next attempt she made was scarcely more successful . 
All the paragraphs from Germany were calculated to inspire her with the most serious apprehensions . 
-- But these might be exaggerated statements -- Caroline endeavored to think so , and to find comfort in the contradictory accounts in other papers of opposite parties . 
-- While she , her father , and mother , were employed in this manner , one of the turnkeys came in , to say , that an old man , Mr. Percy 's steward , wished to see him . 
While his master was writing , John stole a look , which he had never ventured yet , at his mistress and Caroline -- and bowed to each -- but as to speaking , that was out of the question -- for some time -- at last he recollected a note Rosamond had given him for his mistress , and laying it down , he said , -- `` Might I make bold to axe , Madam , is it true what the gentleman who let me in was telling on me , that this here place is not in the nature of our county jails , but that master will have liberty to walk about as he pleases , and only the gates and doors locked at night , like as for any gentleman 's own house and place at home -- If so be that 's true , it would be some comfort . '' 
-- But still he delayed -- Moving slowly towards the door , he said -- `` I wish your honor your health , then , and that , please God , you may be soon down with us again , Sir -- My mistress the same -- And Miss Caroline '' -- The thought that she was no longer Miss Caroline , again stopped him , and his feelings at last forcing their way fluently into words , he exclaimed , `` What will my poor woman say , when I get home ! 
-- She , who is looking to hear of nothing but o ' the wedding and joy -- Little guessing , no more than myself , how our Miss Caroline 's wedding-day was to end -- Lack-a-day , the bride , too , that I myself see , but yesterday this time , the beautifullest bride that ever was seed , and all the power of ladies and gentlemen wishing of her joy -- And here she is , locked up in a prison -- the bridegroom gone ! 
Rosamond was excessively anxious to be permitted to stay with her father , or at least to be allowed in her turn every other week to take the place of Caroline or of her mother , whose health would be most likely to suffer by continued confinement . 
Letters arrived from Count Altenberg , which did not tend to put Caroline more at ease . 
Till at length , when all was arranged , and Caroline had reason to hope , that his next letter would announce his setting out , public affairs again demanded delay . 
The letters he wrote to Caroline breathed the most ardent affection , expressing in different ways this strong sentiment , ` I could not love thee , dear , so much , Lov 'd I not honor more . ' 
Caroline prepared for the anxiety that must be more or less the lot of the wife of a man in Count Altenberg 's public situation , bore it with fortitude , and however it preyed upon her mind , she never uttered any expression of impatience or complaint . 
Her husband 's reputation and her own duty were her first objects ; and whatever she suffered in the performance of one , or in the hope of his attaining the other , appeared to her of inferior , and comparatively small importance . 
-- It was not merely in the generous emotion or transitory heroism of the moment , that she offered , when she saw her father arrested , to stay with him and share his imprisonment ; she was aware of what she offered , her resolution and affection were sufficient to sustain her through the protracted sacrifice . 
Nor did she appear to think it a sacrifice -- Never for an instant did she remit those daily , hourly , fond and grateful attentions , which convinced her father , that she did not repent the determination she had made . 
About this time , as if fortune was determined to persist in showing herself averse to those , who had never thoroughly believed in her power ; another calamity , which no prudence could prevent , befel them . 
-- Soon after they had received letters from Colonel Gascoigne , giving the most satisfactory account of Godfrey -- saying that he had obtained the highest character among his brother officers , and that he was returning home ; just about the time when his father expected to see him came intelligence , that the transport , in which Major Percy 's division of the regiment was embarked , had been separated from her convoy by a gale of wind in the night , and it was apprehended , that she had been taken by the enemy . 
-- Caroline 's color fading , and her health beginning to suffer from anxiety . 
-- The list of the papers was , as Alfred found , drawn out by Buckhurst Falconer ; and the Commissioner now recollected the time , `` Just when poor Buckhurst , '' said the father , with a sigh -- `` was arguing with me against going into the church -- At that time I remember he was desperately in love with your sister Caroline . '' 
Whilst Alfred was comparing the papers and the list , the Commissioner went on talking of the marriage of Caroline with Count Altenberg , asking when they expected the Count to return , or when Caroline would go to him . 
-- Alfred could not stay to listen either to the Commissioner 's congratulations , or to his apologies for Buckhurst 's carelessness , but hurried away to be the bearer of the joyful tidings to his father , mother , and Caroline . 
-- Caroline and Mrs. Percy , almost at the same moment , repeated the same thing . 
I had never known Mr. Gresham myself , but you have all by your letters made me well acquainted with him -- I like him prodigiously , -- to use a lady 's word -- -LRB- not yours , Rosamond -RRB- -- Letters from Mr. Henry were waiting for him here -- He has just opened them , and the first news he tells me is , that Caroline is going to be married -- Is it possible ? 
It was fortunate that Mr. Henry 's letters had been sent before Caroline 's wedding ; as it prevented Godfrey 's knowing any thing of the melancholy confusion of that day , and of the imprisonment of his father -- While his family were debating , whether they should or should not comply with his request of writing him a full account of all things , a letter arrived from Mr. Gresham to Mr. Henry , with information , that Godfrey 's exchange had been actually effected , and that he had just secured his passage on board a vessel for England , which would sail the ensuing week ; no letter therefore could possibly reach him before he should quit Amsterdam . 
His decision made , it was promptly executed -- He left to a friend the transacting the sale of that part of his German property , of which he had not already disposed , and concluded his letter to Caroline thus , `` Passports obtained ! 
-- Every thing done but to pay my duty to the Princess before I leave the country -- Early next week I shall set out for England -- May the cloud , which hung over your father when we parted , my beloved Caroline , be dissipated ! 
Caroline 's eyes involuntarily turned on Alfred as she read the last words -- It was only by strong effort and habitual command of mind , that he could preserve his self-possession under the action of such desperately strong motive , and the sense of such deep responsibility . 
Mr. Sharpe accidentally overhearing the exclamation of Miss Percy , when she thought she had recovered the deed , was apprised of the loss , and conveyed the intelligence to Sir Robert . 
-- - Caroline , my love , you and your husband will meet in perfect happiness , and the sacrifice you have made for your father will make you dearer to such a husband . 
''' Mr. Percy , released from prison , was welcomed with kindness and exultation at the house of Lady Jane Granville , where his family , assembled once more in happiness , were again surrounded by all the friends who had been present at Caroline 's wedding , and again congratutions were heard in all parts of the hospitable mansion . 
-- His prayer at parting with Caroline was granted , and the whole family , whom he had left in grief , met him in perfect happiness . 
-- Caroline , his bride , his wife , radiant with joy and love , he , at last , pressed to his heart , now , and for ever , his own Caroline . 
-- She was recompensed , as she said , beyond her utmost hopes , by arriving just in time to see the reunion of Caroline and her husband . 
-- And no wonder , for the thoughts of Miss Rosamond 's marriage had turned her head entirely upside down -- for she had been at Miss Rosamond 's christening , held her by proxy , and considered her always as her particular own child , and well she might , for a better , except , perhaps , Miss Caroline , never breathed . '' 
The arrival of Count Altenberg , the marriage of Caroline , and Mr. Percy 's long imprisonment , which followed , had prevented his recollecting this message till his present visit .
