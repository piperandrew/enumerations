The youngest -- the youngest of course takes precedence in our society -- was not past eighteen , and , grown to her full stature , rather above the average height ; Grace Herbert differing in most of the faculties , qualities , and circumstances of her being from the average of her sex . 
To a strictly classical eye she was too thin for her height , but of such exact proportions , so flexible and graceful , that the defect was insignificant . 
Her features were of the noble cast . 
Her complexion was neither fair nor brown , but exquisitely smooth and soft . 
Ordinarily she was pale , and her large dark eye lacked lustre ; but a flash from her mind , a gust of passion , or even a gentle throb of affection , would brighten her cheek , light her eye , play over her lips , and even seem to radiate from the waving tresses of her dark hair . 
It was dark , and yet so brilliant in certain lights , that in her little court of school-girl friends , where she was queen -LRB- by divine right -RRB- , it was a standing dispute whether its color were golden , auburn , or brown . 
But it was not form or color that so much distinguished Grace Herbert , as a certain magnanimity in the expression of her face , figure , and movement . 
Her sister Eleanor was some three years older , and many years wiser , in the opinion of their friends , in Grace 's , in all the world 's , save Eleanor 's herself . 
She was sitting on a cushion beside an open , time-stained morocco trunk , heavy with brass bands , and nails , and filled with files of old letters , while Grace sat by a table with a book of Flaxman 's outlines before her , and sheets of drawing-paper , some bearing fair copies of her exquisite models , and others from her own ideals , scarcely less graceful . 
`` Eleanor , '' exclaimed Grace , looking up from her drawing , `` what are you doing with that hecatomb of letters ? '' 
said Grace , with a mournful shake of her head . 
`` They had interest in their time , as our 's have , Grace . 
She ran her eye over the letter , reading aloud a paragraph here and there . 
exclaimed Grace . -RRB- 
did our shallow-pated uncle , '' again interrupted Grace , `` presume to entertain the idea that he could marry a woman Uncle Walter would marry ! 
exclaimed Grace ; `` divine in her unchangeableness . '' 
`` Grace ! 
Grace ! '' 
-- Believe me , as ever , your 's faithfully , `` Is it in that fashion , Mr. Tom Herbert speaks of my father 's losses ? '' 
said Grace . 
As it was the only time he ever spoke to me , he might have found something more pleasing to say ; pale or not , I found partners for every dance , and refused nine!But , darling , I must cut short my epistle , and sign myself , your sincere and ever attached friend , Grace threw down the letter without comment , and took up another . 
asked Grace . 
exclaimed Grace , when the letter was finished , `` and this is what she called a pleasant chat.Why , she is a fair pendant for the old woman Uncle Walter was chuckling over , who found it so hard to part with the old comrade she had enjoyedso much sickness and so many deaths with ! 
See how time-stained they are , Grace , and yet there is an immortal freshness in them . 
`` Yes -- and I had a sort of indefinite wonder that you did so -- that you liked to be with her -- there was something so dread and shadowy about her ; but now , that I know so much more of life -- Grace was scarce eighteen ! 
But read me something out of her letters . 
I remember a certain grandeur about her , a grand silence . 
I wonder if she says any thing of Uncle Walter ? '' 
`` This letter announces her engagement to Frank Silborn . '' 
exclaimed Grace . 
You wo n't care to hear it , Grace . '' 
`` No ; but is there nothing about that ` ideal ' of her 's -- poor Aunt Sarah ! '' 
`` Yes , just at the close she says : ` Frank and I have had unkind words . 
`` Ah , it is all over , '' said Grace , `` she is disenchanted . 
As Eleanor silently folded this letter , Grace , after looking steadfastly in her sister 's face , said , `` Now one riddle is solved for me , Eleanor , and I know why it is that you are of the celestial , and I of the terrestrial : your childhood was passed with this heavenly aunt of ours , while I , left to earthly influences , as you know , though you may never have the bad boldness to say so , have made wings for myself , which Iknow will melt off in the first fiery trial , and leave me to sink , poor mortal as I am ! 
`` And I think , Grace , I loved her without comprehending her . 
Mrs. Silborn 's letters had thoroughly awakened Grace 's interest . 
`` How I wish , '' said Grace , `` that I could find something more about dear Uncle Walter . 
`` Of course she has become a nonentity , '' said Grace . 
`` No , Grace , '' said Eleanor , `` here , in a letter , of four years later date , Aunt Sarah says : ` You inquire about Walter 's boys . 
`` I can not find a mention of Aunt Fanny 's name again , '' said Grace , running her eye over several letters . 
exclaimed Grace , `` and remember perfectly feeling a little ashamed of Uncle Walter that he did not cry ; and saying to him -- from my infancy I have spoken out my heart to him -- ` Why do n't you cry , Uncle Walter ? 
`` But , Grace , it was of free will -- not fate ! '' 
Between him and Grace there is growing a strong affection , founded in congenial natures , with the authority and respect of the parental and filial tie , softened by the consciousness , on both sides , that the duties are voluntary . 
I do not admit the affection is stronger than that which subsists between Eleanor and myself , but there is ever a raciness imparted by difference of sex , and besides Grace will always keep the current of her loves more agitated and more sparkling than Eleanor . '' 
`` Read on , '' said Grace ; and she proceeded . 
Poor Grace is a tropical plant , capable of rich growth and marvelous beauty , but exposed to volcanic perils . 
Grace has an intensity manifested in hot loves and hot hates . 
Poor Grace will reach heaven at last , but through much tribulation . '' 
cried Grace ; `` Aunt Sarah is dreadful . 
`` Aunt Sarah died when you were but thirteen , Grace , and surely you have the best of it . 
Grace read aloud : `` Eleanor has not her sister 's personal or mental brilliancy -- ` a sop to Cerberus , ' exclaimed Grace -- ` but she has that equal temperament that is not liable to disturbances . 
Grace 's is the glassy lake , reflecting with intense brightness , but darkened by every cloud that flies over it , and tossed by gusty winds and giving back shifting shadows . ' 
`` Aunt Sarah is getting sententious , and prosy , '' said Grace , `` but proceed . '' 
Eleanor was ten , Grace but seven when William married Mrs. Carlton . 
Grace went off into a passion of grief and indignation . 
` O , do n't , Grace ! ' 
Poor little Grace seemed resenting a personal indignity -- an irreparable injury , and to this day , whatever Mrs. Herbert proposes goes counter to her grain , while Eleanor , ` ceasing to resist , ceased to suffer , ' and coöperating in the somewhat tedious perfection of Mrs. Herbert 's domestic economy , the harmonies of her nature were not disturbed . 
Poor Grace is in a state of perpetual annoyance , fretted by her step-mother 's foibles , and feeling the bitterness of being fretted by them , for she has a clear self-discernment . 
Fortunately , my sister-in-law has too serene a temper , and perhaps a little too much self-complacency , to perceive Grace 's irritations . 
She honestly thinks both the girls love her , and fancies that Grace with any one else might be irascible , but that she knows how to manage her ! '' 
cried Grace , `` I am the same child yet : her sweet brings out all my acid . 
`` Do not say so , dear Grace , '' said Eleanor , interposing , as a kind-hearted person is too apt to , to fend off the arrows of conscience ; `` this very morning , at breakfast , I was admiring your self-command in making no retort when Mrs. Herbert so elaborately lauded Horace Copley , contrasting him with his aristocratic manners , and elegant taste in dress , with Frank Esterly . '' 
exclaimed Grace , `` how strange that a man like Uncle Walter should go on so unchanged in character , so changed in circumstances . 
A pocket-book marked with grandpapa 's name -- if there should be a treasure in it ? '' 
Grace began to read aloud . 
`` But , Grace ! '' 
Grace read aloud . 
Six months since -- '' `` O , stop there , Grace , '' cried Eleanor , spreading her hand over the page , `` we must not read another word . '' 
`` No , we must not , '' replied Grace , hurriedly refolding the letter ; `` but is it not too bad , just as we perceived the flavor of the apple , and had our teeth upon it ? 
I always thought her a remarkable specimen of human infirmity . '' 
Grace , looking again at the seal and at the superscription , tossed it into the trunk , saying , `` Lock the trunk , Eleanor , and hide the key from me , lest at some weak moment -- . 
`` I do not , Grace ; I have more faith in man 's loyalty . '' 
`` I 'll ask Mr. Esterly , then , '' continued Grace , `` and if he sees a mote in my eye -- why , I 'll clutch at the beam in his . '' 
`` What do you mean , Grace ? '' 
But Eleanor 's heart was still impenetrably veiled from her sister 's eye ; and when a servant opened the door , and said , `` Mr. Esterly is below , Miss Eleanor ; '' `` Did he ask only for Miss Eleanor , John ? '' 
said Grace . 
Though Grace fancied her interest was monopolized by one subject , she set the door ajar , and listened eagerly for Esterly 's retiring footsteps ; and when her sister , after a long delay , returned , she said : `` Have you been all this time arranging your Sunday-school , Eleanor ? '' 
`` O , forgive me , Grace , I forgot to tell him . '' 
`` Blessings on him who invented the opera , as Sancho says of sleep , '' said Grace ; `` four evenings this week it has relieved us from Anne . 
Grace was anti-sympaticato Miss Anne Carlton , her step-mother 's daughter , a young lady about her own age , and a type of a class of young ladies who vegetate in our society . 
`` How I wish Uncle Walter would come in , '' said Grace ; `` we should have such a nice opportunity , this evening , to tease him out of his letter . 
Here is a cause to be decided to-morrow , which will make us very rich -- or leave us -- '' `` Not very poor , Uncle Walter , '' said Grace ; `` we have enough , and more would only inflict on us more care and responsibility . 
`` Upon my word , Grace , it is spoken to the purpose , and it reminds me of Esterly 's last Sunday 's homily . 
`` I trust , Grace , that your professed indifference is more sincere than Mr. Horace Copley 's . '' 
`` You areyoung , Grace . '' 
`` And I hope I shall die young , '' retorted Grace , `` if I must become suspicious , distrustful , and unbelieving , as I grow older . '' 
`` Tut , tut , Grace ! 
And yet , Grace , when he has contested for three years -- point by point -- a property that I believe in my soul rightfully belongs to us , and has been so ruled by three successive decisions , from which he has appealed , I can not -- quite -- trust him , Grace , when he assures you at a ` matinée musicale , ' that he is indifferent to the result . 
`` Thank you , Grace , yes -- I do -- it 's false -- it 's false . '' 
`` You and Eleanor must settle it between you , '' said Grace , with girlish pique . 
Her feathers had been a second time ruffled by her uncle 's persevering disparagement of a young man , who , though not her professed lover , had been marked in his admiration of her . 
and he is the friend of your friend , too , Grace ? '' 
Grace did not reply immediately . 
She was wondering how it was that her sister should be acquainted with facts in Mr. Esterly 's life that she was ignorant of ; but returning to the point , she replied to her uncle : `` O , all that I know about this young lawyer is , that he led me out to dinner at Mr. Jones 's , where you know Mrs. Herbert dragged me . 
He was hurrying out of the room , to communicate the decision to the young advocate , when Grace arrested him , and in her sweetest voice -- its sweetest tone was a syren 's to his ear -- `` Now , Uncle Walter , '' she said , `` you ca n't go a step , if our bread depends on it , till you have granted me one favor . '' 
Grace snapped her fingers , and kissing him , cried , `` That 's enough -- now go , dear old uncle . '' 
`` No , no , Grace -- it is not enough , '' said Eleanor . 
Grace , where is it ? '' 
Grace thrust her hand into her pocket , and produced it . 
exclaimed Grace , `` what can this mean ? 
`` Thank heaven , that we did not , Grace . '' 
`` There is not , dear Grace . 
It was originally purchased by two gentlemen of the names of Herbert and Copley , and , singular enough , after various sales and transmissions , the controversy is now between descendants of the original purchasers , ` Copley versusHerbert . ' 
Miss Grace Herbert was one of the party . 
He was hovering about her with the expectation , no doubt , of leading her to dinner . 
My hand trembled , the ruddy wine spilled over , and went rippling down Miss Herbert 's lustrous silk . 
It was in vain that Miss Herbert was gracious and kind , and ready to laugh it off with a woman 's ready wit . 
Grace Herberthad not seen Archibald Lisle since the memorable day when he enacted second part to Goldsmith 's bashful man . 
`` Indeed , how should we , Mr. Lisle , '' said Grace ; `` my uncle having been our teacher and exemplar through life ? '' 
Grace , to a careless eye , might not have seemed sensitive to her uncle 's criticisms , but in relation to her , Lisle 's was not , even at this day-spring of their acquaintance , a careless eye . 
`` A little overdrawn , dear uncle , '' said Grace . 
`` Not a particle , Grace -- not a particle . 
You , Mr. Esterly , are of course pledged to your cloth ; and you , Nelly , '' he added , and finished the sentence in a whisper , that crimsoned her cheek . 
He patted her head , and smiled . 
inquired Grace . 
Lisle 's eyes turned sparkling to Grace , while Mr. Herbert said , laughingly , `` O , a feather , Grace -- a wild-goose 's feather , will turn a scale ! 
Without any purpose , beyond a tilt of her wit with her uncle , Grace had already said enough to charm a young man who , in his narrow social sphere , had never chanced to meet a young woman with rare gifts , set off by high breeding , and the mighty accessories of youth and beauty . 
Lisle would have detected worldliness or artificialness , by the test of his own simplicity and sincerity ; but the seeming contrarieties of Grace Herbert 's character , her quick mutations , her deep thoughtfulness , and sudden irradiations , were surprises , and , strange to say , had the fascination of riddles to plain dealers like Lisle . 
He was ignorant of the terms of the art , and even of the phrases and names on the lips of every frequenter of operas now-a-days ; but rarely had Grace been so acceptably flattered as when , sitting down to her piano at her uncle 's bidding , and playing an Adagio of Beethoven at his suggestion , she accidentally turned her eye up to Lisle and saw his face glowing , and his eye moistened . 
When Grace wants to flatter me , Mr. Lisle , she tells me I am the original of that old song , so we agree to call it my song . 
Go on , Grace . '' 
Grace sang it with expression and charming significance , and , coming to the lines , `` And quaffed a cup of good old wine , '' etc. , etc. , As she faltered at the last stanza of the song , to Lisle 's evident vexation , Horace Copley entered . 
Slightly bowing to the company he approached Grace , and said , `` Have you forgotten your engagement , Miss Herbert ? 
Grace rang the bell , told the servant to bring her hat and shawl , made a hurried apology to Archibald Lisle , and disappeared , as he thought , like a beautiful vision . 
`` And who , '' inquired Lisle , `` is the Mrs. Tallis , who sent Copley for Miss Herbert ? '' 
I am always charmed with Grace Herbert 's music ; there is soul as well as her delicious voice in it . 
`` And is it possible , '' exclaimed Lisle , `` that this is the world that Miss Grace Herbert lives and moves , and has her being in ? '' 
The fine castle in the air , which Uncle Walter had built , in the shape of an independent home , in which he might set up housekeeping with his beloved nieces ; the wise plans of charity that Eleanor had founded on the contingent fortune , and a tour to Italy , the land of her desires , which Grace had projected with her sister , and Uncle Walter , all vanished with the lost lawsuit , and this most unworldly trio , reverted , with hardly a sigh of regret , to the beaten track of their daily life . 
Eleanor and Grace are quite welcome to him . 
The most sagacious may be at fault as to who will marry who ; but this much I will say -- if either , Grace . '' 
`` O , of course , Grace , '' replied the young lady , petulantly , `` she is always putting herself forward , and Eleanor is so retiring -- worth a million of Grace , I could tell them , if they asked my advice . 
Miss Grace Herbert , with all her out-spokenness , keeps her cards to herself , and plays them well , too , while poor Eleanor thinks nothing of the game . 
It 's my private opinion , mamma , that Grace is just finessing with Esterly , to catch that king of trumps , Copley . '' 
`` Then , in plain phrase , Grace will never accept the reverend , while she has the faintest hope of Horace Copley . '' 
`` But she can not have even the faintesthope . '' 
So many circumstances come into the formation of our conclusions , which , after all , maybe erroneous ; you know Copley admires Grace ; certainly she is very clever , and she is thought beautiful , though you and I are not of that opinion ; and it is impossible to say what a young person of her powers mayaccomplish . 
`` My dear , '' recommenced Mrs. Herbert , reprovingly , `` I was going on to say , that Copley is the sort of man to amuse himself , nowflirting with Mrs. Tallis , and nowplaying upon Grace 's vanity , while he has all the while a serious purpose at heart , that he will cautiously withhold till the right time comes . '' 
`` It is provoking , '' said Anne , `` that our gentle blood should come through the Herbert channel . 
he sees no one , heeds no one , but Grace . 
I should like to solve the mystery of Grace 's attractions . 
Copley appreciates the advantage of fortune and position -- Grace disdains them . 
I would like to know if any analysis of human nature would tell me why Horace Copley did not dance with Grace last evening , but once with me , and ever so many times with Mrs. Tallis . '' 
He may have intended to make capital with you , for I am sorry to say , Anne , you seem to prefer the ultrafashionable young men , who flirt with married ladies . 
Or , after all , he may think that Grace is on the brink of an engagement with Esterly , and so thrown out . '' 
Would it not be delightful to have Grace married ? 
Mrs. Herbert ` sfamily were punctual church-goers , and none of them wandered from their own fold excepting Grace . 
Poor Grace had such strong magnetic repulsions as well as attractions , that it overset her devotions to sit next Mrs. Herbert or Miss Carlton . 
Mrs. Herbert observed that Grace 's eye was fixed on the rector , and that even he could see the tears that stole from that beautiful eye over her glowing cheek . 
Grace 's mercury was up to that fervid point , which is an ordinary temperature with enthusiastic young women of eighteen . 
Uncle Walter , '' exclaimed Grace , `` how I wish Eleanor had a little more enthusiasm ! '' 
`` Eleanor 's enthusiasm , '' replied Mr. Herbert , `` turns the mill , while yours , Grace , plays the fountain . 
For instance -- '' `` Oh never mind the instance , ma'am , '' cried Grace . 
Grace was nettled by Mr. Herbert 's implied rebuke . 
`` He should have , Grace . 
`` Ah , Grace ! 
`` On my word , I do not , '' continued Grace , vehemently . 
`` Grace ! '' 
`` Not now , not now , Grace , '' said her sister hurriedly , `` it 's past eleven ; we must go to bed . '' 
`` If the house were on fire , I believe you would go to bed at eleven , Eleanor , '' replied Grace , impatiently . 
Both sisters proceeded to their disrobing , but when Eleanor laid her head on her pillow , Grace sat down on the bed-side , her dark tresses streaming over her night-dress , and her eyes lighted with the excited and brilliant color of her cheek , and said eagerly , `` Eleanor , '' and then bending her head , she kissed her sister 's cold cheek , and added in a lower tone of her sweet , rich voice , `` Eleanor , my counselor and guide , you must hear me now ! '' 
`` Speak on , Grace , '' replied Eleanor , turning her head away from her sister . 
`` And so love him , Grace ? '' 
`` Has he asked you , Grace ? '' 
`` I shall be no longer blind , Grace . 
`` Good-night , dear Eleanor , '' said Grace , bending over her sister to kiss her . 
It is to be hoped that the rector was as faithful to his clerical duties as to his lay devotions at the Herbert 's . 
Grace suffered herself to flow on with the current , secure , with Eleanor 's authority , in awaiting the decision of her feelings when the time came . 
`` Which of your bracelets was it , Grace ? '' 
It was soon after this that the Herbert family awakened to the fact that Eleanor was becoming thin , and pale , and nervous , not irritable , but discomposed by trifles , and tearful when no one could guess the cause . 
said Grace , impetuously , `` that you thought my sister so ill ? 
`` My dear , '' replied Mrs. Herbert in her calmest manner , `` you were pre-occupied . 
Young ladies , '' she added , with a smile , `` are often one-idead ! '' 
Nothing in the world provoked Grace so much as her step-mother 's cold truisms . 
`` My dear Grace ! '' 
`` Allow me to say , Grace , you are too apt to obey your impulses . 
Grace paused for a moment , struck with the fact that the rector weighed lightly in the balance against her sister , and then said , `` Consult my sister ! 
thought Mrs. Herbert , as Grace left her . 
Eleanor Herbert did the work of charity , not as a servant , working for hire , but as a child , serving with filial love . 
She instructed the ignorant without esteeming it an act of piety any more than she would have called the conducting of a friend 's child through the perils of a crowded street , an act of friendship . 
`` She gave with simplicity '' knowledge , time , affection -- all she had to give . 
`` No , '' she replied , `` Grace can not leave New York now -- I must go alone . '' 
He rang the bell , and so violently that Mrs. Herbert , Grace , Anne Carlton , the servants , rushed in at once , and Walter Herbert , just coming through the hall-door , was there too . 
shrieked Grace . 
Grace , half frantic between sudden terror and sudden joy , was dashing all on at once . 
Mrs. Herbert , always imperturbable , brought order out of confusion , but it was a long time -LRB- to Grace it seemed an eternity -RRB- before the hue of life returned to Eleanor 's cheek . 
If Mrs. Herbert were exploded from the crater of a volcano , as Grace once said of her , her first utterance would have been a flat truism . 
Oh , Grace , did not I look pale ? '' 
Grace , without listening to Miss Anne 's silly egotisms , was supporting Eleanor to their own apartment . 
There , Eleanor felt something like self-reproach while she was receiving Grace 's tender ministrations . 
Grace , entirely unsuspecting , was exclaiming at due intervals , `` I am glad Frank Esterly sees now how ill you are . 
`` Grace , '' she said , `` I have something far more generous to ask of you , than going to Cuba with me ; but leave me now , for a while , till I am rested , and can summon resolution to tell you what it is . '' 
When , after a refreshing sleep , she awoke , Grace was sitting on her bed-side , fondly watching her . 
`` Grace , '' she said , looking up with a very serious smile , `` I hardly know whether my waking thoughts are dreams , or my dreams realities . 
I am very happy , but I am sure I could not be so , if I thought I had done you a wrong , or crossed you in any way . '' 
Grace gazed , as if a faint light were dawning . 
exclaimed Grace , springing away from her sister ; `` I see -- I see it all , '' she said , rushing up and down the room , while the clouds of frail humanity shadowed her fine face . 
But the sun broke through , and throwing her arms around her sister , half laughing , and half crying , she said , `` it is all right and fitting , Eleanor . 
`` Yes , and that conviction has given me inexpressible comfort this evening , Grace . '' 
After a moment 's consideration , she added , `` I understand it all now . 
`` Rest there , Grace , in that blessed conclusion , and listen to me for a moment . 
Eleanor assenting , Grace went , but to her extreme disappointment , he expressed no surprise , but merely bowed his head with a pleased and provoking affirmation `` I know -- I know . '' 
You are destined to many a hair-breadth ` scape , Grace , but our mistakes and follies are our best teachers , our ` sternest , and our best , ' if we early enough take the lesson , and lay it to heart -- experience can scarcely be called a ` stern-light ' to a girl just eighteen . '' 
Grace 's thoughts reverted to the intimations of his life in the green morocco trunk . 
He coolly said what he believed the `` intervals of their meeting were to Miss Herbert . '' 
Lisle 's ideal was verified in the beauty -LRB- an element in all young men 's ideals -RRB- the bright intelligence , the loftiness , the unworldliness , and the fearless sincerity of Grace . 
If he read an exciting poem , if he saw a picture that charmed him , his first thought was , `` what would she think of it ? '' 
Grace did not in this case . 
Perhaps her perceptions were dulled by the confident and self-complacent demonstration of most of her admirers , or were restrained by the rebuke to her vanity in her sister 's affair . 
She might have been misled by her Uncle Walter 's frequent reiterations that he could not get Lisle to the house . 
Why the deuce , Grace , do n't you beam on him , for my sake ? '' 
Lisle 's interposition availed , and it was characteristic of him to say nothing of it to Mrs. Clifford , and not to hint at what cost of sweet expectations he had sacrificed his proximity to Grace , at her sister 's wedding . 
Lisle was a fortified island ; but the hour and the woman came , and before the magic of a correspondent nature , the tide swept in and swept out ; still the barriers that nature had set , and habit maintained , stood , and not a human being knew he loved Grace Herbert -- not Mrs. Clifford , his most confidential correspondent -- not Uncle Walter , who , in his own genial nature had an open `` sessame '' to every other chamber of Archibald 's heart . 
His sphere scarcely touched Grace Herbert 's , but from that illuminated world he had some flashes of intelligence through Walter Herbert , whose frequent pleasure it was to drop in upon his younger friend . 
`` Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh , '' and he seldom came and went without some mention of Grace . 
`` Grace , '' he said , `` has taken to studying the old English poets . 
You never heard Grace read , Lisle ? 
Anne is in her right niche , ` made to order ' for a watering place ; but poor Grace frets in the harness . 
I think he is on his knees to Grace . 
I ca n't lose my child ; and , though he 's a fine fellow , with family and fortune , and all that , and all that , yet I do n't fancy Grace going where she would be received upon sufferance -- looked down upon as an American , and have to follow into dinner at the tail of trumpery Lady This and Lady That . 
No , my Grace is a queen in her own right . '' 
I do n't quite see into Grace -- women are tickle tackle . 
Months followed , marked by a few incidents , soon forgotten by Grace , but making epochs in Lisle 's life . 
He sent them to Miss Herbert , and calling to see her the next evening , she naturally adverted to his `` lovely spring flowers . '' 
He asked her if she had observed among the blue violets a few white ones , of a species new to him , and fragrant . 
She had not , and ringing the bell , directed John to bring down a bouquet from her library-table . 
not that , John , '' exclaimed Grace ; `` I told you my library-table . '' 
He left Grace blushing at certain natural inferences from his excuse , and returned with poor Archy 's flowers , drooping and hanging their pretty heads , it would seem in silent sympathy with his sinking heart . 
Mr. Lisle , '' exclaimed Grace , `` I am ashamed ! 
Lisle passed it alone with Grace and her uncle . 
`` Uncle Walter '' was supremely happy -- Grace electrifying . 
Lisle made a remark upon it that particularly struck and pleased Grace . 
Not two months after , in a society where they met , Grace said , quoting his remark , `` Somebody , I ca n't recall who , said so-and-so to me . '' 
Lisle had not forgotten a word she uttered that evening , nor a shade of her expression . 
He devoted himself unremittingly to his business . 
Why , Archy , if it were not for the pain , it would be a luxury for me to have a fit of the gout , for Eleanor to brew my possets , and Grace to caress , and amuse me . 
You have only seen her in the drawing-room , where , for the matter of knowing the variety , the power , the sweetness , the divine nature of such a woman as Grace , why , you might as well look at her full-length picture . '' 
`` Shall I bring Eleanor and Grace with me to the ship , to-morrow morning , Lisle , to bid you good-bye ? '' 
The four years over which our history has leaped , had brought Grace to the ripe age -LRB- in our fine world -RRB- of twenty-two . 
Awakened by Grace 's entrance , she opened her eyes , and stretched her arms toward her . 
Grace caught her up , embraced her vehemently , waltzed around the room with her , calling her fond names , and then laying her down , she gazed at her with an expression half curious and half sad , and sighed . 
`` Nan gives you a smile for your sigh , Grace ! '' 
`` But , dear Grace , life is like a picture . 
`` But , dear Grace , you know as well as I that happiness is not got by running after it . '' 
exclaimed Grace , `` I am glad you have come in ; Eleanor was just beginning one of her lay sermons , which I particularly dislike , because they always end with leaving me in the wrong , convinced , but not cured ; and what is the use of conviction without amendment ? 
He left the room with a nod to Grace , but turned back to say , `` I am not sure I shall return to dinner . 
exclaimed Grace ; `` I should detest a man , if he made me responsible for the order of his drawers , and the starching of his shirts . '' 
`` What transformation is there , '' continued Grace , `` in the old myths , half so horrible as that of a lover into a husband ? '' 
`` Then , Grace , he has gained in rationality what I have lost in homage . '' 
`` My dear Grace , you are in a worse humor than poor Frank , this morning , but still , I think it would do neither him , nor you , nor me good if I were to be vexed with him , or with your attack on my husband , and fly out upon you for it . '' 
`` I will , Grace . '' 
`` Pray , my darling , '' interrupted Grace , `` do you indite Frank 's sermons for him ? '' 
`` If I did , Grace , my next should be on patience , and you should be the ` awful example . ' '' 
`` When he will not , like a cross horse , bite his mate whenever the harness galls , '' interposed Grace ; `` but go on , Eleanor . '' 
`` Frank is never deliberately unkind , or even inconsiderate , Grace . '' 
You know , dear Grace , there is a law of nature , by which running streams , if not disturbed by external forces , deposit their impurities , and so I think our affections by this divine law will become purer and purer , till the mortal stream passes , in crystal clearness , into the ocean of eternal love . '' 
`` I certainly did not mean , Grace , to make any such pharisaical pretension . 
But , Grace , I have faults quite as serious as his , and far more annoying to him than his are to me . '' 
You must come too , Grace ; and ask Uncle Walter . '' 
`` And , if I remember , Grace , you liked him before he was a traveler ? '' 
said Grace . 
`` Do not be quite so professional in your slurs , Mr. Frank , '' said Grace . 
The eyes of both husband and wife glanced at Grace , and then met . 
Grace colored slightly , while she said carelessly , `` I suppose travel has had its usual effect in polishing your friend ? '' 
But truly , Grace , I did not look at the tie of his neckcloth , nor am I quite sure whether a moustache adorn his face or not -- neither could make , or much mar him . '' 
Grace sighed . 
Possibly she thought of men 's different tastes in investments , for , the preceding evening she had heard a snobbish friend of Horace Copley enumerating , with a tailor 's precision , the costly articles of his luxurious wardrobe , and conclude with a sum total of & dollar ; 2,000 for annual investments in coats , vests , etc. `` Pray , Frank , '' continued Grace , pursuing their subject , `` can a man , just well started in his profession , lay it down and resume it at pleasure ? '' 
echoed Grace , `` the demon that haunts the American mind . 
Grace threw on her cloak , and was abruptly bidding `` good-morning , '' when little May called out , `` Come back , my Grace , and kiss me ! '' 
Grace turned to embrace the child , but she held her at arm 's - length , and looking at her with an expression of detective truth , the Ithuriel spear that children come armed into the world with , she said , `` You are not good this morning , Grace -- you are not myGrace ! '' 
Grace made no reply , but as she went down the stairs , she wiped away hot tears that sprang from a consciousness responding to the child . 
Grace Herbertwas in a false position in our American Paris . 
The inevitable consequence is that our drawing-rooms are not , we believe , quite the vulgar arenas they have been described , but they are for the most part abandoned to boys and girls , whose keen appetite for pleasure has not been dulled by even one campaign experience ; and a woman of two-and-twenty , like Grace Herbert , if not occupied by an engrossing affection , is in this fine world -- if we may risk the ungracefulness of the comparison -- much like a locomotive off the track . 
If she had been absolutely poor and friendless , she would have found a safety-valve in employment . 
If her destiny had been cast in the country , its unmasked life and healthy simplicity would have tended to a serene existence . 
She might , it is true , have made her own life , but as yet she had yielded to the intensity of her nature , not controlled it . 
At this crisis of her life , she was in danger of resigning the control of this element to another in whose hands it would be sure to become a destructive agent . 
`` Oh , Grace ! '' 
she said , `` my own Grace , to-day ! 
`` Oh , thank you ; but Grace , why do you always call grandmother ` step-mamma ' and ` step-mother ? ' 
`` The red rose and , I guess , the bouquet too , came from -- '' Grace put her hand over the child 's lips , and while she laughed and struggled , Eleanor said , `` Wherever it came from , Grace , it becomes you ; but it is a camelia , May -- a Japan rose . '' 
`` So it is ; and Mr. Copley said -- have not I guessed , Grace ? 
Eleanor looked at Grace as if to verify Mr. Copley 's opinion . 
Her eye met her sister 's , and Grace 's eye fell . 
May put her chubby little arms around her aunt 's neck caressingly , and said , `` Now do n't be angry with me , Grace . '' 
you little spy , '' said her mother , `` or your Aunt Grace wo n't let you stay with her , when Mr. Copley is there . '' 
`` In that case , my dear , yours will be a united family , '' said Grace . 
`` Don ' t chastise the parents over the child , Grace , '' said Eleanor ; `` depend on it , we shall never hate whom you can love . '' 
Little May was perplexed , but snatching at a meaning , she said , `` Do you love Mr. Horace Copley , Grace ? '' 
The child knowing but one quality of love , was quite satisfied that she outrivaled Copley , and Grace prevented further queries by asking her sister if she expected any other guest than Mr. Lisle ? 
You see , Grace , I could not help myself . '' 
`` Did you set her right , Grace ? '' 
He turned his eye to Grace . 
`` Yes , Uncle Walter , '' rejoined Grace , patting his bushy gray head ; `` the only boy , and welcomed and loved because you are a boy , and always will be ! '' 
He was merely bowing to Grace , when she cordially extended her hand . 
`` Confound her , '' muttered Uncle Walter , in a tone so low , that Grace alone heard it , and she forgave it . 
But the ill-sorting guest -- the bad ingredient -- did not , as Grace had predicted , spoil the dinner ; the other materials were too strong and too flavorous to be so overpowered . 
`` Excesses , Uncle Walter , '' said Grace , `` after your dinner yesterday in Fourteenth-street , where , you told me , each guest was rated at twenty-five dollars a head ? '' 
`` My dear Grace , do you think I bring our little transcendental woman 's hospitalities into comparison with such a feeding and pricing fête as that ? '' 
I keep my satire for Grace -- who feels it . 
said Grace . 
`` What 's that , Grace ? 
But , Grace , none of your arch smiles at me . 
echoed Esterly , in a voice that reached Grace 's quick ear . 
Grace interposed to shelter him from this teasing hailstorm of Miss Adeline 's . 
In reply to some inquiry of Miss Herbert 's , Lisle said , `` You can hardly imagine my Vandal ignorance on these subjects when I went abroad . 
You may possibly remember , Miss Herbert , an evening I passed with you , in looking over a portfolio of fine engravings ? 
`` Yes -- I think , '' replied Grace , hesitatingly ; `` yes , I do . '' 
That evening had left but a faint shadowing in Grace 's memory . 
`` Because you confessed , sir , '' said Grace , `` that , like Sir Toby , you never loved the arts . '' 
She developed my love of art -- for , from the moment Miss Herbert touched the ashes , I was sure there was some fire in my soul to be uncovered . 
`` As she is the delight and consolation of those who can not travel through Italy , '' said Grace . 
But come , my dear fellow , tell us something of the living world -- of ` the million , ' who , after all , saving your presence , my dear Grace , interest me more than Michael Angelo , or Phidias . '' 
Why was it that Grace Herbert , who had no ignorant or fine-lady indifference to topics of such moment as these -- why was it that she felt a sensation of immense relief when the conversation was suddenly stopped by the invasion of little May , who had been impatiently awaiting the signal for her admission ? 
`` Here , May , '' called out Uncle Walter , moving back from the table , and planting his knee for her . 
May looked as if all good angels had brought their gifts to her birth-day ; health and strength to her blooming cheek , and rounded and agile limbs , intelligence to her serene brow , gladness to her eyes , and love to her sweet lip . 
The `` clouds of her immortality were yet trailing '' around her . 
Archibald entered into an aside talk with her , to which she lent a gracious ear -- children are instinctive physiognomists . 
His reply was heard only by his next neighbors -- Grace smiled , and Lisle murmured an involuntary assent . 
Poor Grace tried to make Copley admire your boy the other day , Esterly ; but even his pliant lips refused a genuine smile . '' 
`` Surely , '' interposed Grace , `` there is enough in Paris to employ , for any length of time , any amount of intellect or taste . 
Grace did not reply -- her thread tangled , and her needle unthreaded . 
`` Yes , '' said Esterly , continuing the topic with , as Grace thought , irritating pertinacity , `` he has favored us with intimations of his intimacy with Liszt , and Mendelssohn , and other musical geniuses , and his performance at a concert where there were royal guests ! '' 
`` Miss Herbert a particular friend of Copley ! '' 
Grace rallied -- she thought her brother-in-law 's raillery persecution . 
To Grace 's unspeakable relief a servant opened the door , and said , `` Miss Herbert , Mrs. Tallis is waiting for you . '' 
Lisle was escorting Grace to Mrs. Tallis 's carriage , when he encountered Copley awaiting her at the street-door . 
When the carriage drove off , Copley asked Miss Herbert when Archibald Lisle returned ? 
Tallis was not in a happy humor , and he rather disturbed Grace with his cynical remarks , `` Look at Jo . 
Osborne , Miss Herbert , '' he said , `` he comes every night to the opera , with about as much ear for music as Bully Bottom -- or I. Hear Phil . 
He leaned toward her and whispered , `` Bad taste this ! 
Grace did not reply , or smile . 
whispered Tallis , sneeringly , to Grace . 
` A child 's face in simplicity , a woman 's in sadness , ' thought Grace . 
`` Mr. Lisle seems on a very cordial footing with her , '' replied Grace to Mrs. Tallis 's inquiry . 
`` Why , '' said Mrs. Tallis , `` the old man is Steinberg , you know , Grace -- the old German that keeps such nice music in his little shop in Canal-street . 
Grace recognized the flashing of Miss Adeline Clapp 's silk , as , attended by an old gentleman , whom she partly led and partly shoved , she pushed through the black coats that filled the middle passage of the parquet to the place vacated by Archibald 's friends . 
Grace came to the front of her box for the last act . 
The music and Miss Herbert 's presence were in harmony . 
Grace was rather amazed at what seemed to her but an impertinent persecution on the part of a vulgar rustic . 
Grace Herbert and her step-mother never quarreled , neither did they bespatter their lives with bickerings ; they were both too well-bred , but they had no sympathy , and therefore no reciprocal happiness . 
Grace was tormented with self-dissatisfaction , partly from the pressure of high aspirations , and partly from a well-grounded discontent with her own mode of life . 
Mrs. Herbert studied Grace 's happiness and convenience in her domestic arrangements , and made known , but not unknown sacrifices to it . 
`` Take the carriage , Grace , by all means , '' she would say ; `` to be sure I did intend going out , but I always enjoy making a little sacrifice . '' 
Mrs. Herbert was perpetually in action , doing something , or suggesting something to be done , a disposition annoying to one of Grace 's rather indolent temperament , who , lapsed into her own world of imagination , was disturbed , if not fretted by Mrs. Herbert 's incessant materialities . 
She came into Grace 's room on the morning after the opera , with a French engraving elaborately framed . 
`` My dear Grace , '' she said , `` I have bought you a picture to hang in the place of that olddiscolored Madonna by your bedside , and then instead of that old-fashioned table under it , doplace there the one Anne gave you at Christmas . '' 
Mrs. Herbert seldom entered Grace 's room , but when she did , she was sure to suggest some new arrangement of its furniture , that rather amused than annoyed her . 
On this occasion , instead of the sudden irradiation of countenance , Mrs. Herbert naturally expected from her gift Grace 's brow clouded . 
`` Thank you , ma'am , '' replied Grace , and conscious how tardy and how cold were her thanks for the picture , she now expressed them . 
But Grace , '' she added , `` since you seem to set a value on that shabby old picture , I will have it newly framed for you ; it really looks dingy on your newpaper . '' 
`` You are very kind , ma'am , '' said Grace , `` but pray let the old picture remain just as it is . '' 
She only mentally added one item to the great account of Grace 's oddity , and entered a credit to her own magnanimity . 
Grace hastily wiped blinding tears from her eyes . 
`` You will go to Mrs. Tallis 's reception with Anne and me , this morning , Grace ? '' 
`` But , dear Grace , really it is your dutyto go . 
`` There 's comfort in that , '' murmured Grace . 
exclaimed Grace at the first pause . 
Again , to Grace 's infinite relief , she shut the door , and Grace turned musingly to the old picture , saying mentally , `` I would not exchange it for all the galleries of Italy ! 
Grace 's last recollection of her mother was of her hanging this picture beside her crib , and then folding her in her arms , while she murmured a prayer . 
Time had interpreted the action , and the vision of her parent was blended with the glorification of maternity in the sweet Virgin-mother . 
Grace should have simply told the fact to Mrs. Herbert -- Eleanor would have done so , Grace could not . 
Grace thus reports the `` reception '' in the following letter to Alice Clifford : `` When I think that school-girls ' friendships are , for the most part , mere accidents of propinquity , I rejoice that ours , like all true matches , was fore-ordained . 
I propose walking , but am prevented by one of my step-mother 's eternal remonstrances , ` Dear Grace , you have on a carriage-dress -- it is not the custom to walk to matinées . 
` Ah , Grace , do you know , the other day I brought our May here to see Mrs. Tallis 's little girl . 
There now , Miss Herbert , that lady is bowing to you . 
``` No , Grace , you know I never go to parties . ' 
``` That is not my conclusion , Grace . 
`` She smiled with a pensive gravity -LRB- that spoke no admonition , but left one on my conscience -RRB- , and said , ` We must all keep our own accounts , dear Grace . ' 
What do you think of that , Miss Herbert ? ' 
`` I am sure Julia Travers felt the blush that burned my cheek , as suddenly rising , she whispered , ` Do n't , dear Grace , polk with my cousin Horace . ' 
Poor Grace ! 
But Grace was not deceived . 
There could not be a stronger contrast than between his ardent , steady gaze in Mrs. Tallis 's beautiful face , and the perplexed look of blended hope and fear , of homage and love , that he raised to Grace 's face ; between his assured tone to the married woman 's greedy ear , and the tremulous voice of curbed passion , in which he said truly , `` My head is giddy . '' 
Grace felt herself often compelled to a conformity to the Vanity Fair she lived in ; but in the momentous article of the toilet she adhered to her own creed , and maintained her self-respect in spite of the wordy batteries of her step-mother . 
But Grace had perseveringly declined these gracious aids , and had turned a deaf ear to the repeated suggestions of `` how easy it would be for her , if she would only give her mind to it , to imitate the trimmings of Anne 's French hats , or to embroider collars or pocket-handkerchiefs like Anne 's '' Grace was persistent in her opinion , that there was a certain dignity in wearing a dress correspondent to the fortune of the wearer ; and she held her time -- though not flattering herself with any very valuable results from it -- at too dear a rate to be wasted in emulations of French milliners and Parisian embroiderers . 
Grace saw something parvenue , and , in honest English , vulgar . 
So conscience and pride both sustained her in a simplicity , which Anne Carlton whispered , `` did very well for Grace , as every one called her a ` classic beauty , ' and she was of that odd kind . '' 
`` Wear this dress as often as you can , Grace , '' said Mr. Herbert , resuming the conversation where Mrs. Herbert had dropped it ; `` it 's quite perfect -- no furbelows -- not an ornament . '' 
`` No , my Grace , that fell to Eleanor in the division of your mother 's jewels . '' 
He started away from Grace , and walked to the window , and casting off these haunting thoughts , he exclaimed , `` Here is your carriage , Grace ; it 's a cold night -- do n't keep the coachman waiting -- do n't fall into the detestable egotisms of fine people , who think that all sensations are bound up in their delicate bodies . '' 
said Grace . 
`` We immolate ourselves in a great cause , '' said Grace with a sigh . 
`` No sighing , Grace ; do not be pharasaical , it does not become you . 
`` No , Grace can bear the unvarnished truth . 
Grace sat down , folded her arms , and was silent . 
She did not conceive that she expiated the folly she committed by theoretically condemning it , and she found no consolation in the secret impulse that carried her with the current , night after night into the arena of Vanity Fair . 
Besides , she was now in no spirits to measure the weapons of her wit with her Uncle Walter . 
And what isa young woman in Grace 's position to do ? 
Besides , '' looking significantly at Grace 's bouquet , which was lying on the table , `` it will be but a shortsacrifice . 
Uncle Walter went on -- `` Tell me , Grace , to-morrow , how many overworked sleepy men you met , dragged into these joyless revels by their wives or daughters -- wretched victims ! 
And Grace , my dear , see if poor Tallis is not biting his nails , and looking daggers at Copley , polking with his wife . 
`` Thank heaven , '' said Grace , `` here comes Anne at last ! '' 
asked her mother . 
Mrs. Herbert held Grace 's bouquet , while she put on her cloak . 
`` From whom , Grace ? '' 
said Grace , in a low voice , `` you are north-east to-night -- not yourself . '' 
`` I am not the trifler I sometimes am , '' he replied , gravely ; and then putting his arm tenderly around her , he conducted her to the carriage . 
With her foot on its step , she turned to him for his good-night kiss , and said , `` You have filled my atmosphere with blue devils , dear Uncle Walter -- make the ` reverse passes ! ' '' 
He kissed her . 
Grace did the thing out of season . 
`` What upon earth ails you , dear Grace ? '' 
`` Well , one does get nervous waiting , and I beg your pardon , Grace -- and I will tell you how it was . 
`` Take mine , '' said Grace ; `` you will really oblige me , Anne . '' 
Grace spoke in the sincerity of her heart . 
The young ladies met their matron escort in the cloak-room , and met there , too , Miss Adeline Clapp , who , bedizened , be-flounced , and be-flowered , as if to demonstrate how much she could afford to wear at once , was a most striking contrast and foil to Grace , even to Miss Carlton , who was expensively and elaborately appareled , according to the laws of those Medes and Persians , Paris milliners and French maids . 
whispered Miss Carlton to her chaperone ; `` pray give me your arm ; Grace wo n't much mind entering with her . '' 
And Grace did not . 
He was in the midst of a sentence when Miss Herbert entered , and he finished it so abruptly , and with his eye averted , that his listeners turned to see what had diverted his attention ; and one of them said , `` Lisle , there 's a lady beckoning to you . '' 
Lisle advanced , but not yielding to destiny , he passed Miss Adeline with a bow of cold recognition , and joined Miss Herbert , whom , his imagination being sent off into flowery regions by the hollyhock , he mentally symbolized by the beautiful lotus , so pure , so graceful , so queenly she looked amid that garden of living , but very artificial flowers . 
Grace had not yet gone so far into the sere and yellow leaf , as to be left to the penance and mortification of the society of her own sex ! 
Grace 's spirits were relieved by the change , and she was unconsciously stimulated by a spirit correspondent to her own . 
They fell upon topics that interested them both , and , without being disturbed by the few stragglers that now and then found their way from the ball-room , they loitered away a half hour ; to Grace , a half hour of pure enjoyment that she seldom found in society ; to Archibald , one of the few half hours of life whose minutes have an indefinite extension , and whose end is like a stroke of doom . 
Lisle bit his lips ; Grace looked grave and icy ; Mrs. Tallis shrugged her shoulders , and Copley , who had entered all gayety and devotion , was like a masquer surprised without his mask . 
`` I came here , as you know , '' he said , in a low voice , to Grace , `` solely to meet you . 
Why , may I ask , '' he added , in his most deliberate utterance , giving Grace time to circumnavigate the whole world of feeling while he paused on a word , `` why did you give the flowers to her ? '' 
An evasive answer rose to Grace 's lips . 
Mrs. Tallis had fixed her soft brown eyes on Grace , while Copley was speaking to her . 
Copley had withdrawn from Grace , and was sitting moodily at a table covered with objets d'arts , apparently occupied with examining them , but really watching Grace , and Archibald , who stood near her , fixed by her magnetic power over him . 
I never talk to any but married ladies -- and -- '' He looked at Grace , and paused , not exactly knowing how to finish with the compliment he designed for her . 
His reply was interrupted by their hostess , Mrs. Seton , who , having too much bonhomie in her nature to be fashionably indifferent to the pleasure of her guests , advanced , saying , `` Dear Miss Herbert , do n't you dance to-night ? '' 
said Copley , rising and offering his arm to Grace ; `` Your promise to me was only deferred . '' 
He had watched Grace , from under his half-raised lids , a second time that evening talking with apparent interest to Lisle . 
Lisle turned away , dissatisfied with Grace , and dissatisfied with every thing around him . 
He could not look on her while she was dancing the polka with Copley . 
Neither reason , time , nor absence had abated Archibald 's devotion to Grace . 
Never was pleasure approached with feelings less attuned to it than Grace 's when she suffered herself to be placed within the ring of dancers . 
That word `` embrace , '' which Mr. Herbert had uttered so emphatically , rang in her ears . 
Grace had habitually danced the polka , like other young women , unreflectingly -- shielded by her own purity , `` in wardship of her innocence . '' 
She lost her self-possession in observing Grace and her partner . 
Her movement was irregular , and the two ladies came in contact , slightly disarranging Grace 's hair , and Mrs. Tallis 's point-lace . 
While the maid in waiting was sewing the tear in Mrs. Tallis 's magnificent lace , which her husband had given her a few days before -- at a cost of some thousands , as a peace-offering for a taunt to which she had provoked him -- Mrs. Tallis , quite unconcerned at the accident , was looking steadily in Grace 's face . 
Grace returned Mrs. Tallis 's gaze . 
What odd creatures we are , Grace Herbert ! 
Grace shook her head . 
Grace , '' she added in a whisper that rung in Grace 's ears long after , `` Horace Copley does notlove you ! '' 
She had grasped Grace 's arm . 
Grace silently and coldly drew back . 
`` I have been very foolish , '' she said , `` I do not know what possessed me to run on as I have done ; but you will forget it all -- come -- we have been here too long , we shall be missed -- come along , Miss Herbert ! '' 
But Grace did not follow . 
Mrs. Tallis could revert to the gayeties of the drawing-room ; Grace could not . 
She sat lost in the depths of not very pleasant reflection , when she was aroused by Miss Smythe , who came to say that Mrs. Seton was afraid Miss Herbert was faint or ill , that she staid away so long . 
There was something in Grace 's voice or face that startled the young lady , for looking at once serious , she said , `` Oh , Miss Herbert , I beg your pardon -- I quite forgot , but you know , if it is so , it has not come out yet . 
But do come down , dear Miss Herbert -- I am engaged for six dances ahead . 
And then , offering to reconduct Grace to the drawing-room without going down the public stair-case , she threaded the private passages of the house to one connecting with the dancing-room , to which three or four young men had retreated . 
Grace 's cheek burned . 
`` Did you see Grace Herbert bolt when they came into close quarters ? '' 
Grace revolted from hearing her name in their mouths , and again retreated to the dressing-room , Miss Smythe following . 
echoed Grace in a voice that checked her tittering . 
But come , dear Miss Herbert , I really must return to my partners . '' 
She did so , and Grace followed the little parcel of frippery , in no humor to return to the gayety , but anxious to observe Copley and Mrs. Tallis . 
One tableau-vivantestruck Grace . 
Her sleeves were looped to the shoulder with diamond agraffes , `` showing off and setting off '' -- so Copley said -- `` her divine arms . '' 
They did not see Grace -- they were working out their own problems . 
Supper was announced , and Copley , starting from his absorption , encountered Grace 's eye , and moved by a resistless force , he sprang toward her and offered her his arm . 
Grace felt a triumph in that which brought him from Mrs. Tallis 's to her side , and he , rejoicing in its effect without analyzing it , forgot Mrs. Tallis , forgot his poor resentment at the transfer of his bouquet , and Grace forgot all her vexations , and the evening that had begun in clouds , ended in the coming out of one star of hope and promise after another -- preluding a fair to-morrow . 
Anne Carlton accepted it , saying in a low voice to Grace , in Copley 's hearing , `` You will not object to walking with Mr. Copley ? '' 
The night was fine , the distance short , and Grace -- and certainly Copley -- was quite willing to accept the necessity . 
They had passed beyond the crowd of coachmen and attendants , when Grace perceived they were followed by a light , quick footstep , and looking behind her , she saw a woman 's slight figure enveloped in a shawl . 
Grace was shocked . 
Grace made no reply . 
Mrs. Clifford 's letter , to which the foregoing is an answer , intimated a curiosity to know Lisle 's impression of Grace Herbert since his return . 
He did not , our readers may have observed , once mention her , except in connection with her sister at the naval breakfast . 
Thepursuit of Grace Herbert was the present business of Horace Copley 's life ; he had set upon it the force of an unbending and relentless will . 
He had turned toward one of these one bright morning , when he was disappointed by finding Grace `` not at home , '' and vexed , by learning she had gone on some `` charity scout , '' as he termed it , with his cousin Julia Travers . 
And as to my dear little sister , why she has loved this boy , not only with a mother 's instincts , but she has seemed to identify him with her husband , and to have a blending of her wifely loyalty with her maternal tenderness ; hope , and joy , and pride -- pride so sanctified by love , that it is scarcely pride -- are centered in her little Herbert . 
We here interrupt the reading of Miss Herbert 's letter , to interpolate some circumstances which she , for reasons no doubt best known to herself , omitted . 
`` You told him Herbert was better , Bridget ? '' 
`` And I did ; but he asked , too , was Miss Herbert here ? '' 
`` I bade you tell every one that I was engaged , Bridget , '' said Grace . 
`` But he looked so craving-like , Miss Herbert , I just asked him to walk in , and I would tell yourself . '' 
`` Tell Mr. Copley Miss Herbert will be down directly , '' said Eleanor , with a smile . 
`` Do go , Grace , and thank him for me , as well as yourself . 
Grace went , nothing loath . 
`` But my dear Gr -- Miss Herbert ! '' 
Grace shook her head . 
Grace was too evidently pleased by his concern , but she declined , saying , that though the child was better , he needed more than ever all the resources of mother and aunt to entertain him . 
Lisle paused on the threshold as if he felt himself an intruder , as well he might , seeing Copley bending over the chair in which Grace was seated , and talking so earnestly that he did not hear the door opened . 
Copley 's supercilious bow as he turned and saw him , seemed to him to express the insolence of triumph , and the blush that dyed Grace 's cheek at his startling interruption of the tête-à-tête , indicated the radiant happiness of a young woman in the presence of her lover , forgetting the world , and oblivious of the pressure of anxiety in her sister 's house . 
`` We have neither seen you , Mr. Lisle , nor heard from you , for a long while , '' said Grace , contrasting , in her own mind , as she filled the awkward silence with this common-place remark , the devotion of Copley , during their anxieties , with the negligence of Archibald . 
replied Grace , `` it is the slave-driver of the North , worse than the dragons of old , that lived on fair damsels and young children . 
`` There are some fortunate exempts , '' retorted Lisle , and conscious that he felt savagely , if he did not appear so , he was relieved by the reappearance of the servant-girl , who said , `` Mr. Esterly is in the nursery , sir , and little Herbert -- poor little man -- hearing your name , is out of himself to have you come to him , and if you please , the mistress bids me to show you up . '' 
All the toys of Paris would not have bought from May the glad shout with which she greeted Archibald 's entrance , or the soft caress of the little boy , as he laid his pale cheek to Lisle 's , and said , `` Erby loves you all the world , Archy Lisle ! '' 
When Grace shortly after returned to the nursery , Archibald was in low and earnest conversation with her brother-in-law ; her sister was out of the room , and she took her post at the bed-side . 
The friends parted , and Grace , while watching the sleeping child , resumed her letter to her friend : `` Time is the nurse and breeder of all good , '' Alice . 
At Grace 's last suspension of her letter to Alice , she was confident of the child 's recovery . 
Grace was rushing through the entry when Mrs. Herbert , who had caught the news , called out , `` Grace ! 
Grace ! 
Calmness is essential on such occasions , and I am alwayscalm -- do you hear me , Grace ? '' 
said Grace , and rushed through the outer door , and out of sight . 
Ten minutes brought her to Eleanor 's nursery . 
Little May was lying on the bed beside her brother , probably with no comprehension of the change to him , for her glowing cheek touched his , and her arm was thrown caressingly over him . 
Grace spoke not a word , uttered no sound , but fell on her knees beside her sister , and with all the fervor of her spirit joined in the prayer Esterly was offering in a low , tremulous , but not sad voice . 
Esterly was not conscious of Grace 's presence . 
We should not have presumed to withdraw the veil from this sacred home experience , but for the inevitable necessity of showing its effect on Grace . 
May was present when they were brought in , and when her mother said , ` Come with me , Grace , and place these around our dear little boy , ' May ran away , and just as we had arranged the flowers , she reappeared , her apron filled with white azalias , and violets stripped hastily from their stems . 
asked Grace , at the conclusion of a conversation on the subject which had startled the household . 
You sigh , Grace ! 
WhenGrace returned from the funeral at her sister 's house to her own home , Mrs. Herbert , after little a-hem-ing , said , `` Grace , I wish to consult you -- or rather , I wished to say to you that I hope and trustEleanor 's feelings will not be wounded by Anne not putting on mourning . '' 
Grace made no reply , and the lady proceeded , `` It may appear odd to see you in mourning and Anne in gay colors -- they are wearing verygay colors just now -- but poor Anne has just received her orders from Paris , and it would be a trial , you know , to lay such lovely things aside , and see all the world coming out in fresh fashions before her . 
Still Grace made no answer , and she proceeded , `` What style of mourning do you propose , Grace ? 
`` My dear Grace , I did not mean to hurt your feelings , but I mustsay I do think Eleanorhas thought about it . 
`` Why , she said I had always been so verykind to little Herbert , that she was sure I should do everything that was right . '' 
and Grace went to her own apartment , leaving her step-mother wondering that her sister 's affliction had not at all softened her ; and Grace sharing the wonder in her own way , for as she mounted the stairs she said to herself , `` If I and my step-mother meet in heaven , will the first word she speaks to me rasp my nerves ? '' 
Grace pondered over each elaborated phrase , searching , as an alchemist would for gold , for one spontaneous effusion of feeling , and finally she threw it down , ejaculating , `` I hate this way of writing -- if he loves me , why does he not tell me so simply and directly , and ask my love in return -- could I answer him simply -- directly ? '' 
Persons of Grace 's temperament are apt to mistake impulses for inspirations . 
In her desire to relieve the monotonous frivolity of her life , Grace had repeatedly been present at the `` circles , '' the technical designation of those séances , where the natural laws are supposed to be suspended , that fond mortals may hold social communion with immortals . 
She had become interested in a belief which relates to the mysterious elements of our being , and which she found implicitly accepted by a few sound minds and many honest ones -- `` men veracious , nowise mad . '' 
On one occasion she had gone , at the invitation of a friend , to a large house in one of our finest streets , where a suite of elegant apartments were devoted to the reception of the spirits . 
While Grace was looking at these records , smiling incredulously , her eye was caught by a sybil , who , in a trance , was giving to the commandant at -- , a communication from his daughter , who had recently died . 
It was such as might come from the beatified spirit of a child -- tears poured down the soldier 's cheek -- Grace felt herself irresistibly drawn into the circle , and beside the `` medium . '' 
Suddenly she opened wide her half-closed eyes , and fixed them , as if spell-bound , on Grace . 
The blood rushed to Grace 's cheek . 
`` I do not wish it , '' said Grace firmly , governed by her previous cool judgment . 
Grace made no reply , but by a fervid grasp of the hand , and hastily withdrawing from what was becoming to her a `` charmed '' circle . 
Grace was not a believer in mesmerism , spiritualism , and other kindred discoveries , -LRB- ? -RRB- 
Grace had been told that this medium had the power of extracting from a letter the spirit and character of its writer , by simply laying it on her bosom , without opening it . 
Grace ordered a carriage , and in the twilight set off to find the residence of the seeress . 
`` Fit abode for an astrologer , oracle , seeress , ` medium , ' '' thought Grace , as she ascended the almost perpendicular steps to the door , divided horizontally into two equal parts . 
At the call of the massive knocker , the head of a `` little marchioness '' peeped over the lower section , who , on being told that Miss Herbert had private business with Miss Ida Roorbach , led her up a dark stair-case to an attic apartment , where , after lighting the three burners of a tall Roman lamp , she went to summon her mistress . 
She , as her name indicated , was of mixed blood , her Dutch father having married one of those omnipresent aspirants , a Yankee itinerant teacher . 
The seeress probably owed her spiritual inquisitiveness to the maternal source , as the Dutch superstitions were of the material order , concerning themselves chiefly with haunted houses , and human subjects . 
Grace smiled as she read its title , and the thought crossed her that it might serve her oracle instead of the intoxicating fumes from the Delphic cave . 
Grace had the curiosity to examine a set of seals strung on a hooped serpent . 
Archibald Lisle had told Grace of this vision , which greatly excited her imagination at the time , and she now felt as if she were breathing a preternatural atmosphere . 
Grace stood for a moment embarrassed , and really awe-stricken , though to a rational observer , there seemed nothing in the little modest woman before her to inspire such an emotion . 
After a moment , while the Pythoness waited with an expression of benign inquiry , Grace said , stammeringly , `` You will excuse my intrusion -- I want to ask a favor from you -- help . '' 
`` Of me ? '' 
she replied , looking up half incredulously at Grace , who , in the power of youth , beauty , and elegance , stood head and shoulders above her . 
`` I am not so -- I am not , '' cried Grace , vehemently -- `` I am staggering in the dark , and want light , more than ever mortal wanted it . '' 
`` Mine is a most perplexing exigency , '' replied Grace , and then added , for she dared not evade the simplicity and truth that impressed her with reverence , `` No , perhaps I have not sought counsel where I should , but other 's judgments are fallible as well as mine -- I want unerring guidance . '' 
said Grace , giving her Copley 's letter . 
It is the spirit of the writer which is manifested in me , and to me . '' 
She drew a chair for Grace , and one for herself , but before sitting down , `` I can not oblige you , '' she said , `` unless you first assure me that your correspondent is free from bodily disease . 
Grace assured her there was no risk in the present case . 
Her simplicity , the guilelessness of her manner , her freedom from all charlatanrie , her faith in herself , inspired Grace with a conviction of her truth and her power ; and all combined , heightened the solemnity with which she awaited a revelation from the arcana of nature . 
After some moments of silence , unbroken save by the loud beating of poor Grace 's heart , Ida Roorbach 's countenance recovered its usual sweet and composed expression , and beckoning Grace to her , for she was too much exhausted to rise , she laid her ghastly hand on her and said tenderly , in a low , quivering voice , `` I could not speak -- my lips were sealed ; and having been so by an irresistible power , I can not , dare not , now unseal them . '' 
`` I do not know how I looked , '' she replied , mournfully . 
Grace returned to her home . 
She had opened the book of prophesy , and it was steeped in shadows . 
Miss Herbertwent in , on her way to her sister 's , to Steinberg 's music-shop . 
The door was ajar that communicated with a little inner parlor ; and while she was tossing over some sheets of music on the counter , she heard voices . 
`` Then continue to come ; do , Archy -- I have no other pleasure , '' she added , in a more cheerful tone ; but the last word did not reach Grace 's ear , for the children at this moment made an inroad , followed by old Steinberg , who passed into the shop . 
He was interrupted in his excuses , by Grace asking if those were his children ? 
no , Miss Herbert ; my old woman and I are not Abraham and Sarah . 
While Grace hesitated , Lisle came into the shop . 
The sight of Miss Herbert checked him . 
Grace gave no faith to it then , or now ; but her curiosity was awakened , and her feminine imagination had woven a tissue out of Letty 's sweet and sad tones ; so she graciously accepted the old man 's invitation , and followed him . 
`` Excuse , '' said old Steinberg , addressing Letty , `` this is Miss Herbert , just looking in upon the little ones . '' 
At the sound of this name , Letty 's pale cheek reddened , and her soft , meek eye met Grace 's . 
Letty shrinking from the potent lady , whom it seemed presumption to regard as a rival , and Grace averting her eye with a feeling that might be thus translated into words : `` Had that fellow , Belson , the audacity to eye this sweet , modest young woman with suspicion ? 
`` My friend , Mr. Lisle -- or rather your friend , '' she said , `` for I believe he is much more your 's than mine -- is your teacher ? '' 
exclaimed Letty , overpowered by the grace of Miss Herbert 's practiced manner ; `` oh ! 
`` To give you German readings , '' said Grace , smiling , and anxious to relieve poor Letty 's embarrassment . 
exclaimed old Steinberg , rubbing his hands ; `` but , Miss Herbert , I have not told you my little ones ' names yet . '' 
This duty he eagerly did , and Grace , after kindly chatting with them , to their delight , in German , took her leave . 
Theirs is the same -- mine immeasurably below them . 
But her love is not like mine ! 
As Grace emerged from Steinberg 's shop , she met Horace Copley . 
`` My milliner must have the credit of it , '' said Grace , blushing , `` for I have been but once out of the house since our little boy 's death . '' 
Grace 's blush was due to the thought that the exception was her visit to Ida Roorbach . 
Grace would have said , but she merely murmured `` Well ? '' 
Grace felt a recoiling as , looking up at Copley , she met one of those inquisitorial glances by which he seemed to divine her inmost thoughts . 
Grace breathed a long breath . 
Grace thought , and would have said , but that her attention was suddenly arrested by two men who stood on the steps of Esterly 's church , and just in the shadow of its arched entrance . 
They were talking earnestly , and seemed watching Grace and Copley as they turned into the gate leading to the parsonage which adjoined the extreme end of the church . 
In the mean time Copley rang the door-bell , and the bell not being immediately answered , Grace observed that all the blinds were closed . 
`` Ah , I remember , '' she said , `` they were going out of town for a day or two . '' 
said Grace ; `` what has happened ? '' 
Big tears rolled down Diana 's black cheeks ; she wiped them away with the end of her white turban . 
Grace took a long breath , but her more immediate fears relieved , her interest turned to the poor old petted servant whose alarm and agitation were pitiable . 
`` Do come into the parlor , Miss Grace , '' she said ; `` please follow , Mr. Copley . '' 
`` The hounds is gone , for the present , '' she continued , `` but the Lord have macy on us , they 'll come back , there 's no saving of her . '' 
asked Grace . 
said Grace , `` dear old Di ' , they shall not take your children from you ; Violet shall come home with me , I will conceal her till I find some way of saving her . 
And turning to ask Copley 's advice , she saw he was standing with his back to her at the end of the room , absorbed apparently in contemplating a small picture of herself which he had taken from the wall to get a stronger light upon it . 
`` Oh , come here , Mr. Copley , '' she said with a slight tone of impatience , `` have you not heard poor Di 's story ? '' 
`` No , '' he replied , his tone now indicating a cordial interest that enchanted Grace ; `` but I will execute whatever your quicker wits devise . '' 
Grace snapped her fingers , an apt action with her , denoting the rapid movement of her brain . 
Grace , in her eagerness to carry her plan into effect did not apprehend the full import of his words . 
said Grace , `` are you not satisfied ? '' 
Grace 's countenance fell . 
At first Violet seemed dissatisfied with an arrangement that separated her from him , but when Dian had reiterated Copley 's assurance , and whispered something of which Grace heard the words `` rich '' and `` her suitor , '' she seemed partly reassured , and went up stairs with Grace to prepare for her masquerading . 
Grace reappeared with her protegée . 
`` There is an endowment of grace and refinement in your very shawl and hat , Miss Herbert ! '' 
`` Oh , no , '' replied Grace , `` she is to that manner native . 
Grace saw by the lighted street lamp that the men in wait did not follow , and she rightly inferred that they were satisfied that the parties who went out were the same who entered a half-hour before . 
asked Mr. Herbert , to whom Grace was confiding Violet 's story . 
`` But Grace , consider , my child -- you can not afford to bear your testimony in this way . 
They may demand & dollar ; 1,500 for the mother and child ; Violet is a handsome creature , and beauty , you know , enhances the price of this kind of goods . '' 
Her uncle 's suggestion filled Grace 's eyes with tears , and made her cheeks glow . 
my country ! '' 
Grace 's mind was imbued with an heroic love of country , a sentiment not common in these days of small and importunate egotisms . 
It was further on in the same evening when Miss Anne Carlton 's maid was divesting her mistress of a dress -LRB- which her mother averred had been ` admired beyond every thing , ' at a small party where that lady had been the star of the evening -RRB- that mother and daughter were discussing Grace 's sequestration of Violet . 
`` Really , mamma , '' said Miss Anne Carlton , `` Grace imposes on you . 
She caught the reflection of her handsome face in the glass , and interjected a sentence , seemingly foreign to the preceding , and in a quite different tone : `` Do you know , mamma , that Sabina Reeve says she has not the smallest idea Copley means any thing by his devotion to Grace ; she says it is a way he has of amusing himself . '' 
Does Grace expect you to submit to the police searching our house for stolen goods ? 
`` Grace istrying ! '' 
I am , therefore , notpleased with Grace 's proceeding , and above all , with her bringing the runaway here . 
But you know I stand on delicate ground . 
Her father , by his will , gave her an absolute right to the apartments she occupies . '' 
But , to the point : so long as Miss Herbert keeps the girl in her own apartment , I shall not interfere . 
`` And so you would submit , if Grace Herbert turned us both out of doors . 
They did not come , but at 12 o'clock there did come a pacquet , addressed to `` Miss Herbert , '' in Copley 's hand . 
He had stamped on Grace 's feelings , at the moment of their softening , his own image , beaming with sympathy , generosity and benevolence . 
The unusually happy frame of Grace 's mind was somewhat impaired by the receipt of the following curt answer to the note to her brother-in-law , in which she had communicated what she termed , `` Mr. Copley 's timely and kind intervention in his behalf : '' `` Accept my thanks for an offer , which of course I owe directly or indirectly to you . 
my dear brother-in-law , '' thought Grace , as she refolded the letter , feeling an implication with her lover as an injured party , when she perceived that Eleanor had filled the inner pages of the sheet . 
Give him my grateful acknowledgments ; and , dear Grace , do let your friend know how much I felt his kindness to little Herbert . 
Grace paused , read over the last paragraph , smiled -- sighed -- and then finished the letter . 
`` Pray , Grace , look in upon Cousin Effie , and see that she does not over-fatigue herself with little Nel . 
exclaimed Grace , `` your heart compasses sea and land -- even takes in Anne Carlton ! 
The town , you know , Horace , is giving you to Miss Herbert . ' 
` I have no objection to make , ' she continued -LRB- that is , revered mother , you will not oppose a will you ca n't control -RRB- ` I must confess I should have preferred another selection . 
Your dear father in his life-time tried hard to purchase the beautiful Carlton property next ours , and when I think of what I know to have been his wish , of course it seems to me a pity that you do not prefer Miss Anne Carlton , who is quite as handsome and as superior as Miss Herbert , and more -- -LRB- I wondered what my mother stumbled at -RRB- , and more -- docile -- more like to make a pliant wife . 
Six years since I made a bet with you and recorded it , that I would marry Grace Herbert . 
My temper is not yet changed ! 
`` She cares not a fig for my fortune , or my position -- this gratifies my pride ; for , if she marries me , it will be for what I am , or what she fancies I am . 
I rushed into the street , and found myself before Miss Herbert 's door . 
Miss Herbert heard me as I entered , and came into the hall to thank me for my part in the fugitive-slave affair . 
She sent a flood of healing from her starry eyes into my soul . 
When we came into the drawing-room , her step-mother -- old women are always asking about one 's health -- remarked my paleness , and inquired if I were ill , and followed up her inquiry with an exclamation at a patch on my forehead which I believed my hair covered . 
exclaimed old Herbert , who never lets an opportunity pass of annoying me ; ` I think I heard you boast that a horse well broken like your 's never stumbled . ' 
``` Rolla bowed to destiny , Uncle Walter , ' said Grace ; ` pride must have its fall ! 
`` At that period , viz. , when I was twenty-one , ` a change came o'er the spirit of my dream ' -- the love of my childhood for Grace Herbert revived , with all the force of manhood , and from that hour , with more or less hope , I have loved and followed her . 
Miss Herbert had been unusually cold to me ; and disheartened , I shut myself up at Elm Grove . 
`` I know you have a stern , permit me to say , a fanatical sense of duty , which might impel you to disclose this story of the poor girl , with your partly false impressions of it , to Miss Herbert . 
If you do , it is easy to foresee the effect upon her wounded pride , may I not add , her wounded affection ? 
Miss Travers , with a deep conviction of her cousin 's baseness , and a clear perception of her duty to her friend , had her hat and cloak on , with the purpose of going to Miss Herbert to make a full disclosure , when this letter was brought in . 
She read it through , at first simply with indignation at its false views and false assumptions . 
She read it a second time , and felt there was some truth , mingled with its subtle sophisms ; a third time , and she shrunk from leveling a blow that must strike down her aunt ; a fourth , and , throwing off her hat and cloak , she exclaimed aloud , `` No , I dare nottake this responsibility ; perhaps it is by marrying my cousin that poor Grace is to work out his salvation and her own ! '' 
He had asked Grace to come to her sister 's with him . 
And we shall have one room entirely empty , where you , and I , and Grace can play blindfold , and not hurt ourselves , and break things . 
`` Oh , I am sure it will please you ; the house is palatial ; splendid drawing-rooms , a suite of private apartments for the master , another for the mistress -- we 'll suppose Grace , for sothe world doessay , now -- a magnificent library , a billiard-room , a callisthenic apartment -- in short , every thing that heart of man or woman can desire . '' 
`` I have been twice over the house , '' continued the incessant woman ; `` it 's nearly perfect ; but I could make one or two suggestions to the fortunate intended , Grace , '' she concluded , casting a side-glance , half impertinent and half silly , at Mr. Herbert . 
`` Do n't make them , madam -- do n't speak to Grace -- do n't speak to me of that house , or any thing relating to it . '' 
exclaimed Anne ; `` as if he would not give his right hand to see Grace mistress of that house ! '' 
She had settled it in her mind , that Miss Herbert was Archibald 's fate , but when it was to be accomplished , had the indistinctness and mystery that death has to common minds -- and so had her own future . 
So long as she satisfied her masters , did earnestly her duty to the little Steinbergs , and could pass half her evenings beside Archy , she lived in absolute content with the present . 
And could this have been her eternity , good little orthodox Puritan as she was , we fear she would not have changed it . 
Letty , living out of the world , and having no data by which to calculate its chances , never , for a moment , doubted that Archibald was married to Miss Herbert , and all day her tormented brain was exercised in divining the reasons of the secresy -- `` Why Archy had not even had the kindness to hint it to her ? 
and how in the world Adeline Clapp had found out what Archibald had meant to keep secret ? '' 
She sent away her drawing-master , she vainly tried to get through with her daily task with her pupils . 
Letty in her artlessness , her gratitude to him , and her unworldliness , stood before him in something like reproachful contrast to Grace , who was being overcome by the world . 
Had Lisle , before this crisis , cast off the shackles of his reserve , risen above his self-distrust , and manifested to Grace his unconquered and unconquerable love , she might have responded to him , and risen by the force of her own upward tendencies out of sight of the subtle spell that Copley had addressed to her lower nature . 
It was on the evening of Letty 's death , that Grace , at twilight , was sitting alone at the bay-window of Mrs. Herbert 's library , not gazing at the tints of parting day that smiled on the budding trees opposite , but taking an introspective view , where , just then , a soft and pleasing twilight pervaded too . 
She was endeavoring to overpower the still small voice that yet murmured against her lover , with such thoughts as , `` how kind , how lavish he was to dear little Herbert ; '' `` how generously forgiving of Frank 's obstinate prejudice against him ; '' `` how considerate of his interests ; '' `` how prompt and noble for poor Violet 's relief . '' 
The words , and the more expressive silence , the emotions , and the demonstrations that made the two hours that followed an epoch in the lives of both can not be told -- must not be told , for the time was sure to come when Grace would wish all memory and record of them effaced . 
Such were not Grace 's ; not even then , in those two happiest hours of all her intercourse with Copley , was there the beatitude of a true love . 
In the mean time Walter Herbert was first to be told ; a note was to be written to Eleanor -LRB- a cold tremor seized Grace at the thought of these duties -RRB- and the fact , as in courtesy due , was to be imparted to Mrs. Herbert and her daughter . 
Copley was just transferring from his own finger to Grace 's a diamond ring , to be the symbol of betrothal ; her hand rested impassive in his , while he poured a torrent of tears over it -LRB- whence came they ? 
were questions Grace often afterward asked herself -RRB- , when , at the sound of a footstep in the entry , approaching , he dropped it , and shot off into an alcove at the end of the room , where he stood in shadow . 
`` I am so glad , Grace Herbert , to find you at home and disengaged ; I seldom have that good luck with you . 
Well now I hope I do n't intrude , '' continued Miss Clapp -- it could be no other than Miss Adeline Clapp -- lowering her voice to Grace ; `` I dare say I have broken up a tête-à-tête again . 
I asked her for the pattern , and if she remembers to give it to me , I 'll send it to you , if you wish , Grace . '' 
Copley had quite recovered himself , and , taking up his hat , he replied with his usual coolness , `` Much impertinence , madam , but no possible harm ; '' and then , murmuring a few sentences to Grace , too low for Miss Clapp 's greedy ear , he took his leave . 
`` Miss Clapp , '' said Grace , rising , `` you must excuse me , I -- I -- '' `` Oh now , Grace , I ca n't excuse you . 
Grace had risen , and was quivering with impatience to get out of Miss Adeline 's grasp , but Archibald Lisle 's complication with the insatiable woman turned the tide , and she reseated herself with resignation . 
`` It 's a pretty long story , '' began Miss Adeline ; `` but then , Grace , I know you 'll have a fellow-feeling , when we get into it . 
Grace rang the bell . 
exclaimed Miss Adeline , staring at Grace , as the light flashed on her face , and for a moment she was awed , without comprehending the height and depth of feeling it expressed . 
Well , you know how it is , Grace ; when one is attached , and is , as Dates says , expecting ` relations of reciprocity , ' one do n't give up the ship for a trifle . 
Grace 's interest was now thoroughly excited . 
`` Good heaven , '' she exclaimed , `` you do not mean -- '' `` Hear me through , Grace Herbert . 
Miss Adeline paused , and Grace 's face expressing , even to her dull perceptions , something of the mingled wonder and disgust she felt , `` I see , '' she resumed , `` that you do n't quite feel with me . 
Grace had not heard this long story without arriving at the conviction , that Archibald Lisle had entangled himself with this inevitable woman . 
`` She might have had the politeness to wait till I got out of the door , '' said Miss Adeline , as Grace fleetly vanished up the stair-case . 
Some of our readers may recoil with as much displeasure from Grace 's betrothal as she felt disgust at the presumption of Miss Clapp 's expectations , for there are those who in spite of the discordant matches of every day , will as freshly wonder at every new one as the child , who on looking at an old man with a young wife , exclaimed , `` What a poor two you make ! '' 
Not that the world , in general , by which comprehensive phrase is designated the particular circle in which Miss Herbert moved , would feel any thing other than perhaps a momentary sensation at her rare good fortune . 
But there may be some , who comprehending the nobility of Grace 's nature , will feel a keen disappointment at this crisis of her fate , having believed that though uncontrolled , unguided , unwarned , she would , in Ida Roorbach 's phrase , `` have worked out her own salvation , '' and not have yielded at last to extraneous influences . 
Grace took them at their current value . 
Itwas a significant circumstance that Grace did not communicate to one of her friends , not even to her dear Uncle Walter , her engagement by word of mouth . 
Was it that she instinctively avoided the truth that flashes from the face before the soul is shrouded in plastic words and conventional phrases ? 
He had even , on one or two occasions , eagerly praised him in Grace 's hearing , but the sigh , with which he ended , indicated but too truly an ineradicable disapprobation of the man . 
Grace met Mr. Herbert , for the first time after her brief written announcement to him of her engagement , the next morning at breakfast . 
He was a very late riser , and she was accustomed to give him his breakfast . 
Grace met her uncle with her usual dutiful salutation , and took her seat . 
Grace poured out a cup of coffee ; Mr. Herbert took it , but their eyes did not meet . 
He touched neither , but sat for a few moments , looking out of the window as far away from poor Grace as possible , and then seizing a morning paper he turned over its mammoth pages ; it would not do ; his blinded eyes could not see the words , and the rustling only sharpened the silence . 
Grace sprang to him , and throwing her arms around him , and bursting into tears , said , `` You must not go so , dear Uncle Walter . 
he cried , his heart at last finding vent in words ; `` no , you have done it , my child , my all ; I am foolish , Grace -- I am old -- God forgive me ! 
And then gently disengaging her arms , he seated her on the sofa , and left her sobbing there ; and taking his hat and cane , he left the room and hobbled through the long entry from the breakfast-room to the outer door , then returned , and half opening the door , in a sort of choking between laughing and crying , `` Mind , Grace , '' he said , `` you give me notice to quit in time . 
She read Grace 's missive . 
-LRB- After a pause , -RRB- `` I never heard him admire any thing in Grace but her aristocratic air . 
Not that I defend Brother Walter or Grace , for criticizing us ; they knew I did not approve of intimacies with those men , nor would I exclude them from large parties , because they are not just what they should be -- ` judge not , ' etc. '' `` Oh , mamma , what is the use of talking so ? 
`` I must confess I do not like this levity , Anne , '' she said ; `` and if you really have so low an opinion of Mr. Copley , I own I do not see why you are not willing to give him up to Grace . '' 
If he should marry any one else , I should not hang myself ; but to have Grace Herbert the one taken , and I to be the one left ! 
One thing please give me credit for , mamma -- I never was humbugged by Grace . '' 
`` Why , I always said that Grace was contriving and working for this prize , and would go through fire and water to attain it . 
Now tell me , mamma -- you understand human nature , you know -- would any girl in Grace 's position pass by the opportunities she has had , unless for an ulterior object ? 
Think of a girl , without fortune , rejecting the Honorable Mr. Grey , of a noble English family , possessing every thing that Grace professes to admire . 
Grace is getting on -- she is two-and-twenty , and past . '' 
But , my dear , I do hope you will put the best face on the matter , and congratulate Grace . 
On the memorable evening of Grace 's betrothal , Elise had lingered longer , and clung closer than usual . 
His eyes were hardly yet dried from the tears he poured over Grace 's hand ; his hand was still warm with the pressure of her 's ! 
Grace has always been independent , self-directing , not a person to be interfered with . '' 
`` But , Eleanor , it is true I have been lost in my own affairs , but I thought there was a tacit agreement among us to acquiesce in Grace 's decision ? '' 
`` No , but Grace could hardly expect another romance , ripened into a reality , which ours has been , '' replied Esterly , kissing his wife with the enthusiasm of a lover ; `` once I did hope for its parallel for Grace . 
I thought ` propinquity ' only was wanting to combine their destiny , but before he came home , Grace was entangled in this affair -- her mind , if not her heart , was preoccupied . 
Think how long Copley has been steadily devoted to Grace -- that augurs well . '' 
Grace 's fate may be next best to ours . '' 
Ah , Frank , you do not know Grace , if you think a ` next best ' in marriage would be endurable to her . 
No , she will have nothing , if not a love and confidence like ours -- ever growing ; our smallest joy , and our keenest sorrow binding us closer together ; a mutual dependence , and an individual freedom springing from reciprocal faith , love , and charity ; each a life apart , and a life together . '' 
This long conversation begun at home , was finished on their way to Grace 's . 
`` It is a little odd , Eleanor , '' said Esterly , half smiling , `` that you have bestowed no part of this lecture upon Grace , and that here we are on our way to congratulate her . '' 
`` Oh , I know I was cowardly , '' said Eleanor ; `` I now reproach myself bitterly , but till very lately I thought that Grace could not be dragged into this maëlstrom . '' 
Grace was not radiant , but there was a certain satisfaction evident , such as one feels who has struggled through an entangled path and comes out on a clear road . 
When Mr. Herbert broke away from Grace after that breakfast which was only a fast , he directed his course towards the sole light that glimmered through the darkness closing around him . 
Grace , my darling is -- is -- engaged ! '' 
He tried to master himself , but Letty was dead , and Grace worse than dead , and the world was very dark to him . 
`` You have misunderstood me ; upon my honor you have , Sam , '' said Copley , reddening ; `` and certainly you do not know Miss Herbert . '' 
`` As to that , Sam , Miss Herbert is like other women , comme-il-faut . 
But if you imagine she has been governed by a sordid motive , your judgment may be the natural result of your own experience , but I assure you , it is a false one . '' 
Belson looked askance at Copley with an indescribable leer of derision , and Copley , maintaining his seriousness , and betraying a sincere indignation , which his faith in Grace inspired , Belson said , `` Come , come , Copley , do n't let us fall out now ; I thought you had got beyond woman-worship . 
Upon my word , I meant no special disrespect to Miss Herbert ; I only do not imagine she is an exception to the sex . 
``` Lord have macy on fine ladies for all the lies they tell , ' as poor old Di ' says , '' whispered Uncle Walter to Grace , who sat at his side . 
The blood rushed to Grace 's cheeks as her lover kissed the hand she extended to him . 
After exchanging the common civilities of meeting , he felt that something more was expected , and he said , `` I congratulate you , Mr. Copley ; my wife is perfection -- and Grace is her sister . '' 
`` A littleequivocal , '' interposed Mrs. Herbert ; `` no doubt Mr. Esterly meansthat our dear Grace will go on to perfection now that she is to be sofortunate , sohappy . 
By the way , Mr. Copley , '' added Miss Anne , `` though you did not give all your 's to Grace -- your sugar-plums , I mean -- I was not quite so blind as you may imagine . 
Grace turned her eye upon Anne Carlton ; its flash disclosed the hollowness of that vessel ; she paled under it , and was silent . 
Grace put her hand on his shoulder , and said , in a low accent that meant more than met the ear , `` Uncle Walter . '' 
`` Come , sit down , Mr. Copley , '' said Mrs. Herbert , `` here , near me ; you ca n't do better , since brother and Mr. Esterly have placed Grace a prisoner between them -- verywrong , gentlemen ! 
It was your poor father 's gift to me on our wedding-day ; and now , dear Grace , I present it to you as a pleasant souvenir of your poor father 's bridal . '' 
Grace tried to speak decent thanks , but the words died on her lips . 
`` This is not for me , John , '' she said , and passed the letter to Grace . 
she exclaimed , looking at the parcel -- `` ` Miss Herbert , Bond-street . ' 
Dear Grace , what a quantity of splendid wedding presents ! '' 
exclaimed Anne Carlton , picking up the bracelet , and darting her eyes from Grace to Copley , `` as I live , Mrs. Tallis ' bracelet ! 
To Grace 's sharpened sense every word was clear ; to her quickened feeling , every meaning sharp as steel . 
Grace was kneeling beneath her mother 's picture ; it was the place she had fondly chosen , when a child , to say her prayers , and she had retained it for that holy office with something of the feeling of a Catholic in devout communion with her dearest saint ; she raised her head . 
All struggle was over ; there was a heavenly peace on her glowing face . 
Grace gave Eleanor Mrs. Tallis ' letter . 
Grace impulsively answered to what she felt as an appeal . 
`` Yes , go , dear Grace , and support and comfort her if you can ; but do not silence the reproaches of her conscience ; remember in whose name conscience speaks . '' 
Eleanor paused , Grace rang the bell , and bade the servant order a carriage . 
`` I thought her so weak , '' said Grace , `` I would not have believed there were elements in her for so fearful a tempest . 
`` No , Grace , I think not . 
`` No , Grace , for every reason it is better you should go . 
But do not , dear Grace , in your pity and anxiety for her present relief , lose sight of her future good . 
How different , dear sister , '' she said , as she stooped to kiss Eleanor good-night , `` is this from the sweet peace at your child 's death ! '' 
`` Yes , thank God , it is very different ; but Grace , that affliction discovered moth and rust gathering on our Christian armor , that we had not perceived . '' 
Grace replied with a pensive smile , and as she paused at the door , her face radiant with a sense of her great deliverance , she added , in a low voice , `` May I not say devoutly that ` whereas I was blind , I now see ? ' '' 
At two in the morning , Grace , having withdrawn , from the apartment in which the body of Elise was lying , to Mrs. Tallis ' library , wrote the following letter to her sister : `` When I came to this house , I summoned Mrs. Tallis ' maid , and inquired for her mistress . 
She returned to her child 's low couch , and after having sat by her a long time in thoughtful and tearless silence -- ` Oh , Grace , ' she said , ` I begin to comprehend what you said to me -- that God 's dealing with me was supremely wise and loving ; was not that what you said ? 
But , oh , Grace , meanly , selfishly , wickedly . 
After a pause , she said , with animation , as if the thought had just struck her , ` Grace , Grace , do you think it possible that he can ever forgive me , and forget , and be happy again ? 
``` Yes , I believe he has , ' said I , delighted to perceive the subtle workings of her newly awakened feeling for him , ` and Augusta , such greatness is goodness ; trust to it . ' 
``` I will , ' she replied ; and added , with almost a smile beaming through the sweetness of her face , ` Our child bids me go to him . ' 
`` I wrapped a shawl around her , and supported her , shivering and tottering , to his door . 
He was weeping aloud when she went in . 
I doubt not there was humble and full confession from her , and forgiveness from him . 
The following passage from a recent publication seems to us of so apt an application to Grace Herbert 's letter , that we take the liberty to enrich our pages with it : `` Have you , reader , ever experienced a great sorrow ? 
As he rang the door-bell , a hackney-coach drove up , its door was opened , and a young lady in a gray dress , a straw bonnet , and blue veil , and a Russia-leather traveling sack on her arm -- a railroad costume -- alighted , and running up the steps asked the servant , who answered Mr. Herbert 's ring , with much earnestness in her tone , `` if Miss Grace Herbert were at home ? '' 
He put John aside , and opening wide the door , asked `` If she wished to speak with Miss Herbert . '' 
`` I do , very much , '' she replied , with a simplicity that won a smile from the dear old man , and casting her veil aside , she added , `` Do you expect her in soon , sir ? '' 
`` No , not soon , nor till to-morrow evening , unless you will give me your name , and let me summon her . 
I think she will come at your bidding , '' he added , as he gazed in the sweet and troubled face of the stranger . 
While he obeyed her order , Walter Herbert despatched the following note : -- `` Dearest Grace , come home forthwith . 
`` Why not go to Miss Herbert , Alice ? '' 
Alice proceeded to relate the disappointments attending her visits to Miss Herbert , and at Lisle 's office ; and concluded with saying , `` Now , dear Max , tell me the whole of your troubles from the beginning . 
Miss Herbert was up to the mark , for she wrote me the next day a kind note , asking me to visit them sociably . 
`` Did not go often to see Grace , before he went abroad ? 
After installing Alice in the comfortable quarters to which the Steinbergs had removed , he decided to inform Miss Herbert of her arrival in town . 
Lisle was now deeper in the world than when he wore his frock-coat to Mrs. Jones 's dinner , and previous to presenting himself before Miss Herbert , he repaired to his own lodgings to perform his morning toilet . 
Of course it could only mean the rupture of Grace 's engagement . 
`` She has lost her only child -- quite a severe affliction ; and her husband was absent at the time -- an aggravation , you know ; and she has no near friends , and Grace and she were schoolmates ; she has gone to stay with her till the funeral is over . '' 
But Lisle did not find it possible , and Uncle Walter was compelled to go off with the secret of Grace 's temporal salvation unimparted , and Lisle was left to blunder on . 
He found Grace Herbert with Alice . 
The young women had bridged over the abyss of their long separation with many a pleasant memory , and Grace was casting that spell of enchantment over Alice which can hardly be defined , and certainly not resisted . 
Both Grace and Alice found ground for some vague expectation in the intimations of the Irish lad ; to the young men they seemed without foundation . 
To Alice 's quick and apprehensive observation , it was ominous of evil that Lisle seemed hardly to be conscious of Miss Herbert 's presence , and that when , at the sound of her carriage , she rose to go , he did not raise his eye from some papers he was examining . 
But when she said , `` Mr. Lisle , will it do , or will it not , for this poor little sister to go with her brother to the court-room to-morrow ? '' 
his eye lighted as he turned it on her ; he was about to reply -- he hesitated . 
interrupted Grace ; `` do you imagine I was so barbarous as to propose that ? 
`` To me , Miss Herbert , it might be a blinding evidence , but our judges must be governed by precedent and statute ; however , if you ladies have the courage , I make no opposition . 
`` Then to-morrow at nine , Alice , I will be with you , '' said Grace ; `` and for once I will borrow my step-mother 's coach -- we must invest ourselves in the respectabilities . '' 
The sun went with Grace , and night and dews came . 
When Lisle returned from putting her in the carriage , he found Max gloomily leaning his elbow on the mantel , and Alice standing drooping beside him . 
Lisle was on one side of him ; his sister , Mr. Esterly , and Grace , on the other . 
We shall not attempt to describe the confident hope that actually shone in poor Max 's face , as witness after witness from the houses of Beekwell & Co. , and Smith & Eaton , deposed to the integrity of his character ; nor Alice 's sweet trustful smile , showing even through the folds of her veil , as her eye met her brother 's , nor the gratulation of Grace Herbert 's brilliant face , nor the quiet assured faith of Esterly 's pale , fine countenance , nor how their hopes rose to the highest mark , as Lisle , with all the ingenuity of his profession , and the earnestness of his zeal , converted probabilities -- so it seemed to them -- to proofs . 
He sat down , and Esterly whispered to Grace that their verdict would doubtless be against Clifford , and that she had best withdraw her friend ; but Alice , when the proposal was made , shook her head , `` Oh , let me , '' she said , `` stay with him till the last minute . '' 
Occupation , that mighty helper , and consolation of life , and the best occupation , thought , feeling , and doing for others , had been Grace 's friend in need . 
The few last days had been divided between her ministry to Augusta Tallis , and her solacing companionship with Alice . 
In a letter to her sister , in which she had given a brief history of Clifford 's affair , she says : -- `` I find dear little Alice charming . 
`` The opportunity , '' she continues , `` of serving my friends at this time , has been a providential boon to me . 
They were inclosed in a box , sealed and directed with Mrs. Herbert 's pedantic nicety , and on the box was lying a note from that lady , which being characteristic , I copy for your edification : -- ` My Dearest Grace , you are quite safe with Anne and me ; neither factsnor surmisesshall transpire . 
` You observed perhaps , dear Grace , ' she said , ` that we came home in Horace Copley 's carriage ? ' 
And so , dear Eleanor , she went on , and on , with a deal of ` namby pamby stuff , ' and finding it did not bring me to the point , she said , in a slightly apologetic tone , ` I have thought it judiciousto keep up our relations with Horace Copley to prevent gossip -- the world never gets matters quite straight ; and whether the engagement is renewed or not , myobject is to save your reputation , Grace , from all possible damage . ' 
Grace proceeded to make arrangements for her new life ; and first of all , she inscribed on the parcel containing Mrs. Tallis ' jewels -- blessed talismans to Grace -- `` Vouchers of a broken compact , '' and inclosing , and directing it to `` Horace Copley , Esq. , '' she gave it into the hands of a trusty messenger . 
Grace was shocked to find Eleanor in bed with a fever , and much more ill than she had supposed . 
She was suffering the consequence of too prolonged a strain upon her nervous system , for Eleanor had nerves , though they were sheathed in heavenly patience . 
`` I have come just in time , '' said Grace , kissing her sister 's hot cheek ; `` shall I take possession of your spare room ? '' 
How you will miss not only elegances , Grace , but comforts . '' 
`` Oh , Grace ! '' 
`` Now , '' proceeded Grace , `` you must leave the doing to me . 
`` Come , Grace , come ! '' 
replied Grace , and with a glee almost equal to the child 's , she ran away to partake the ever fresh pleasures of childhood . 
And thus Grace Herbert , the observed of observers who , by uniting fashion to beauty and accomplishments , was perhaps the most admired and the most envied young woman in all our `` Vanity Fair , '' renounced a marriage which would have added to her position the brilliancy of fortune , deliberately left a life of elegant ease and most lady-like indulgence , to live in a very humble suburban house , and earn a frugal living for her sister 's family , by giving `` lessons in music . '' 
`` I am very glad to see you , Mr. Lisle , '' said Grace Herbert , extending her hand , `` and sorry that I am the only one of your friends here to welcome you -- but do n't look so disappointed -LRB- did Archibald look disappointed ? -RRB- 
Mrs. Clifford has gone to the village on business , Max is out shooting , and Alice , '' she was putting her hand on the bell to ring for a servant to call Alice , when a sound was heard , more like the rush of a startled bird , than a footstep , and Alice , gliding down stairs , entered , her face radiant with a welcome sweeter than words could make it . 
and I am so glad ; and were n't you , '' Alice faltered , at a loss for the right word , and then added , not quite as if she had found it , `` surprised to find Miss Herbert here ? 
`` I certainly had no expectation of finding Miss Herbert here , '' he replied , with a slight embarrassment , and averting his eye . 
`` Take care , Mr. Lisle , '' said Grace , `` you are on dangerous ground . 
`` Home is in your mother 's face , Alice , '' said Grace ; `` what a harvest radiance it has . 
Grace looked at her open face , trying in vain to penetrate her meaning . 
Did her quick eye detect the expression of dissatisfaction that shot over her mother 's face , as she glanced her eye from Lisle to Miss Herbert ? 
As he was uninformed of Miss Herbert 's relations with Copley beyond the point of her engagement to him , he was perplexed by its prolonged secresy , and could see no good reason for it . 
He had not met Grace since the day of Esterly 's departure . 
Once he had asked for Miss Herbert at her step-mother 's house , and was told that she was at her sister 's , without a hint of her permanent abode there . 
The complete suspension of social intercommunication in New York during the hot months , accounts for his not hearing the fact , the nine days ' wonder of her fashionable friends , of Grace having become a paid teacher of music ; or their gossiping conjectures in relation to the apparent conclusion of Copley 's devotion to her . 
An unmotived secret must be repulsive to Grace Herbert 's nature , as I once imagined it . 
I ceased to worship from the moment I knew she had declined to his level . 
And her content seems so absolute , as if , instead of this hateful compromise with the world , she had made safe and noble anchorage , not a venture out at sea . 
If she were but infatuated ; but she is calm and satisfied -- satisfiedwith Copley ! 
`` How quietly happy she seems ; no more those alternations of spirit and gentleness , of pride and softness , those sudden mutations that , in my blind idolatry I thought so charming , ` each a lovelier wonder than the last . ' 
Now she seems so self-forgetting , her brilliancy so softened , like sunshine through a curtained window , in such musical accord with the simplicity of this household , that if I did not know beyond the possibility of doubt that she had trafficked herself away in the market of weak and vulgar women , I should fall back into my old slavery ; my old idolatry . '' 
Would not ninety-nine men in a hundred prefer her with her not too much , nor too little intelligence , her cheerfulness and all the sweetening qualities for every-day life , to Grace Herbert ; and shall I be the hundredth to shiver in the shadow of the greatness that is not for me ? 
Can you imagine such an absurdity , Miss Herbert , as letting a servant sleep , and getting up and doing her work ? '' 
`` And would probably be quite as capable of the one service as the other , '' said Mrs. Clifford , looking approvingly , and with surprise at Grace , of whom , as a New York bred lady , she was still distrustful . 
`` Is it true , Miss Herbert , '' she added , `` as I often hear alleged , that women in our towns live in hotels , to escape the trouble of training and governing domestics ? '' 
`` I hear so , '' said Grace , shrugging her shoulders ; `` but really I know little of that genus . '' 
`` The more gracious your estate , Miss Herbert , '' said Lisle . 
`` Nothing is more probable , '' said Grace . 
`` Nothing , '' said Grace , `` has struck me more in Alice than the patience and sweetness of her devotion to Daisy , a most exacting , fretful , exhausting child . 
Grace raised her eyes from the drawing to Archibald 's face ; his eye met hers and he blushed -LRB- Lisle 's youthful infirmity of blushing had of late returned upon him -RRB- ; he blushed as if on the verge of betraying a secret ; he started too , as if awakened from a dream , and Grace , giving to the blush , and the start , and the very grave look , her own interpretation , said , `` I see , as I foresaw -- my subject imparts a value to my sketches ; if you like them pray keep them , they may prove pleasant souvenirs hereafter . '' 
He thanked her , rather coolly , as she thought , and then suddenly recollected that Alice had sent him to ask her to go with him on an errand to Goddard 's . 
While she went for her hat , Lisle stood musing over the sketches , and handling them with the true feeling of a lover , as if Grace 's touch had consecrated them . 
But he did cast his care behind him , and yielded for the hour without further resistance to the magic of Grace Herbert 's charms ; and again in his world she , for the time , shone and ruled alone . 
Grace , utterly unconscious of the feeling she inspired , blinded partly by her past reserved intercourse with Lisle , and partly by her conviction that Alice was his destiny , gave free rein to her natural frankness and earnestness ; and thus with every hour put a new rivet in poor Lisle 's chains . 
Certainly , a striking change was wrought in Grace ; she had arrived at one of those rare and short intervals in any life , blessed with unclouded serenity . 
With all the ardor of her impulsive feelings , that were too apt to rise above the high-water mark of reason and rationality , Grace had -LRB- so she believed -RRB- renounced love forever . 
But it was not merely in a selfish point of view that Grace Herbert contemplated her future . 
She knew that God had instituted relations , and human dependencies , had so bound man to man , had made the happiness of one so dependent on the happiness of another , that no one could sunder the tie and live , in the highest sense of that significant word ; and having withdrawn her maiden meditations from their natural subject , she was surveying , with characteristic ardor , the vast fields of dignified occupation and blessed benevolence patent to a single woman . 
`` Why , they , '' she replied , pointing to Grace and Archibald , who had just emerged from the wood ; `` you do n't play with me all the time when they are here . '' 
if you would only see Grace with my eyes . '' 
Grace had sat down in a rustic chair under a sugar-maple , whose massive foliage excluded every ray of the August sun . 
I heard you repeating to Miss Herbert Archy 's extravagant admiration of her voice , and his telling you that he once heard her quote and ` set to music ' by her delicious voice Bryant 's ` Waterfowl . ' 
This Grace said , mother , and she took the poems with her to-day to test them in their own atmosphere , as you would a portrait by its original . '' 
`` Vanity is ` the most subtle beast of the field , ' my child ; a complex artificial character like Miss Herbert 's is quite out of your ken , Alice . '' 
Grace has infinite variety , but that does not involve dissimulation or affectation of any sort . 
what a name to apply to Grace Herbert . 
Grace 's letters are a history of her life , and a perfect revelation of her character . '' 
Such shilly-shally does not argue any great superiority on Miss Herbert 's part . '' 
Now you know Copley is not worthy of Grace , and you know it from your oracle , Archy who , long ago , gave you such a mean opinion of him . '' 
`` And I still hold that opinion ; but ` he belongs , ' as we say , ` to Miss Herbert 's congregation . ' 
In the trashy society she lives in , I doubt if she could do much better . '' 
To her ardent fancies there was one other mortal not to be graduated by an ordinary scale , and that other being a captivating young man , and now brought with Grace to the romantic accessories of Mapleton , at the moment that she was providentially unshackled , the hour had come when they were to go straight forward to that goal , to which heaven as well as she , poor little Fate , Alice , had predestined them . 
She had gathered from his letters -- the almost preternatural sagacity of a woman in such affairs being rendered more acute by her personal interest -- that Miss Herbert 's intimacy with Copley had , in breaking Lisle 's confidence in her , dispelled her charm for him ; and now that at the moment a fair field was opened for Alice , when it seemed so natural , inevitable , that her favorite , prepossessed in her favor , finding all he had loved in the child ripened in the woman , her domestic education answering to his wants , her qualities and tastes so in accordance with his own ; that her sweet and loveable child should be overshadowed , her mild effulgence dimmed in a more dazzling light , was more than Mrs. Clifford could bear , human as she was , without some injustice to her who was thus thwarting her . 
We feel bound , as we have been compelled to expose Mrs. Clifford 's prejudices , to say that they were not wholly personal to Miss Herbert . 
She regarded her as coming from an `` infected district . '' 
She looked upon the fashionable society of New York much as it has been portrayed by certain popular writers , and if she did not believe that every fashionable woman is a `` Mrs. Potiphar , '' she did hold them all to be vain , vapid , wearisome , and superfluous , and honestly believed that the world would be all the better if they were swept out of it . 
And therefore , independent of her secret deprecation of Miss Herbert 's visit at this juncture , she dreaded the contagion of the fine-lady tastes and habits that would in no wise harmonize with Alice 's life . 
Alice was a famous horse-woman -- Grace remarked to her now thrice happy mother , that none of her accomplishments were lost on Lisle . 
Every house had its piano , and Grace frankly confessed , that her vanity had been rebuked by finding in a rural district those quite as accomplished as herself , in the `` art and mystery '' of music . 
So they went , Archibald and Alice , or Archibald and Grace , or all together , unscathed by gossip 's tongue , `` To the beautiful streamlet by the village side , That windeth away from the haunts of men , To quiet valley and shaded glen ; '' or they winded up through the forest path to that `` Narrow battlement '' Lisle 's position with these two young women , each supremely charming in her own way , would seem a very dubious one , but it was quite plain that no vulgar observer could liken him to the vacillating animal between the two bundles of hay . 
If there were moments when the old habits of his heart mastered him , and when as the blood rushed to his cheek , and an inevitable smile played on his lips at some beaming charm of Grace , he found himself involuntarily at her side , oblivious of Alice 's presence , all his devotions aforethought were to Alice , and Grace , for the first time in her life was left to enact the subordinate part of an observer . 
Lisle 's predetermined , and therefore now duteous devotion to Alice , left Grace much to Mrs. Clifford 's companionship . 
The mother 's prejudices were fused and transfused in her felicitous assurance of the fulfilment of her hopes . 
From doubting the justice of her prejudices she soon came to wonder she had ever entertained them . 
Lisle , with the keen appetite of all American mankind for works of this genus , had seized a newspaper , and was running his eye over it . 
`` No , nothing of any consequence , '' he replied , as people usually do , who first get possession of a fresh paper , unless it chance to contain something as startling as a revolution , or a murder among one 's acquaintance . 
`` Alice has not got beyond ` readings for veryyoung ladies , ' '' said her mother ; `` but you may read it , Archy ; Grace and I will endure it . '' 
The initials only of the real names were given , and as Lisle read them , Grace , who was familiar with the names of most of the notorieties of the fashionable world , filled up the blanks . 
He read on : ``` As in our happy land there are no musty laws , or malicious lieges to impede royal connubial happiness , rumor reports that the hymeneal altar will soon be lighted to unite the fortunate Mr. C -- y to the beautiful Miss C -- n. ' Who should they be , Miss Herbert ? '' 
A painful pervading blush overspread Grace 's cheek . 
Grace saw that he observed it , and perhaps she divined the rapid process of his mind , for she answered , and without faltering , `` Mr. Copley and Miss Carlton . '' 
Alice , when Lisle hesitated , had risen to see for herself , and was looking over his shoulder , her eye riveted to the paper , when the `` speechless messages '' passed between him and Grace . 
Not at the trashy report of the ball was she looking ; another column of the paper had caught her eye . 
The color faded from her cheek , and Lisle might have heard the beating of her heart . 
She rushed out of the open door , and sank down upon the seat under the maple-tree . 
Neither her mother nor Grace observed any thing unusual in her exit . 
She was habitually sudden and rapid in her movements . 
Lisle followed her . 
He seized her hand ; his was tremulous , his voice choking , as he said , `` Tell me , dear Alice -- for heaven 's sake tell me -- '' `` Oh not now , '' she cried , interrupting him ; `` do n't ask me now . 
And snatching away her hand , she sprang from him , and entering the house by another door , went to her own room , locked herself in , and gave way to anxieties she could not repress , and dared not betray . 
Grace drew a brioche to Mrs. Clifford 's feet , sat down , laid her head on Mrs. Clifford 's lap , and sighed . 
or was there `` a little cloud no bigger than my hand '' rising in her spirit 's clear heaven , at the thought of Alice 's `` culminating felicity ? '' 
`` My dear Grace , '' began Mrs. Clifford , and paused ; but feeling sure of herself , sure that her curiosity was not sharpened by any dread of Grace 's interference with her child 's future , that it was only prompted by pure concern for this lovely young woman 's happiness , she was about to proceed , when Grace looked up , her eyes brimming with tears , a smile quivering on her lips , and said , `` Well , what would you say to me ? 
Grace did not find it quite so easy to reply as she had imagined it would be . 
If she answered according to her first impulse , `` not in the least , '' Mrs. Clifford would naturally rejoin , `` what then has disturbed you ? '' 
`` My dear Grace ! '' 
exclaimed Mrs. Clifford , interrupting her , `` that was not because -- it was because -- '' `` Never mind why it was , or why it was not , '' said Grace , smiling , but dreading more to hear the explanation than Mrs. Clifford to make it ; `` my , why , was very simple . 
asked Grace . 
Mrs. Clifford shook her head , smiled , and said , `` Go on , Grace ; we will not let them interrupt us again . '' 
At the conclusion of Grace 's relation to Mrs. Clifford , which was made without any glosses , she said , `` There it is , dear Mrs. Clifford -- the history of my lost years . '' 
`` Thank God , you were saved , dear Grace . '' 
`` Yes , he was occasionally thrown in my way '' -- Grace 's voice sensibly faltered -- `` and I confess light and darkness are not more different than he and Copley . 
Mrs. Clifford had been tempted to interrupt Grace , to remonstrate against her self-condemnation , to give words of her own conviction of the nobleness of Grace 's nature , which impressed her far more than the weaknesses she so courageously unveiled , but she had too much respect for the offices of conscience to interfere with them , so she stifled the words that her heart sent to her lips , and said , `` So , my dear child , you and poor Mrs. Tallis dropped your ` load , ' and pressed on to the delectable city . '' 
`` Aone , Grace ! 
`` Yes , yes , Grace , '' exclaimed Mrs. Clifford , the sudden clouding of her face betraying the pang of grievous memories , `` if one must go through life with the ever fresh sense of irreparable loss , there is left the blessed compensation of children , the holy relation of brother and sister , the vital charities of home . 
Why , Grace , our rustic people generally regard single life as not only helpless and joyless , but almost ridiculous . '' 
`` Oh , as to that , Grace , I know as many of the real scarecrows , the ideal ` old maids ' among pretentious , sickly , fussy , gossiping , crabbed wives as can be found among single women from Maine to Georgia . 
And I have known old maids who have sustained to the end the doctrine of ` perseverance of -LRB- single -RRB- saints , ' inclining me to the opinion of one of my married friends , who says , that it is because matches aremade in heaven that some of the loveliest women are exempted from the -- curse , she called it . 
That is going a little further than you do , Grace ? '' 
`` And a choice , Grace ? '' 
`` She , '' thought the joyful mother , `` is sure of the happiest married life , and Grace -- well -- if single , her life will be a beautiful one , but it 's rather premature at three-and-twenty to set the seal upon it . '' 
thought Grace . 
Grace sat looking out at one window , Lisle at the other . 
Grace had the solace of believing that she periled no one 's happiness but her own . 
`` And we are to go , and leave Grace ? '' 
`` Miss Herbert just remarked the dew was heavy , and -- '' `` Oh , that wo n't do , Archy . 
Then changing her play to earnest , `` You will go , dear Grace , '' she said . 
And with her fleet foot , she was running to Grace 's room , when she called out , `` Come back , Alice . 
And , '' she added , in a tone which Archibald thought superfluously frigid -- to Alice 's ear it betrayed pique -- `` I beg you not to abridge Mr. Lisle 's pleasure . 
Alice whispered emphatically , `` Oh , Grace ! '' 
From his first meeting with Grace Herbert , to the present moment , she had been to him like the sun of a polar summer ; and at Mapleton , unclouded by the obstructions of her town life , her light had continually shone , giving an enchanting lustre to his world . 
She had been so uniformly sparkling with vivacity since Grace 's coming , and she was habitually so frank and bright in her outer life , that in respect to the inner , one might have made the child 's inference , who said , on looking up at the starry firmament , `` if the wrong side is so beautiful , what must the right side be ? '' 
It became evidently necessary to her to have forethought and predetermination about the little , hourly , gracious hospitalities of home that had been spontaneous , and therefore charming . 
The roses were fading from her cheek ; she was moody and pensive , and fell into reveries , and would sigh , or smile , or blush when startled from them . 
She would sometimes try to make an excuse for them ; but poor Alice was no masker , and as these sighs , from seventeen to twenty , have an accepted interpretation , it was not strange that Mrs. Clifford 's family -- including `` the strangers within her gates '' should come to one conclusion . 
Lisle had periled the happiness of more than one , when he tore himself away from silent communion with Grace , and invited Alice to go to the lake with him , with a purpose -- whose firmness he magnified -- of putting the seal and superscription to his fate . 
The old wholesome custom of an early dinner , an hour 's advance of the `` meridian '' of Queen Elizabeth 's time , obtained at Mapleton , and that family rite having been duly performed , and a thundergust having passed away , leaving the air fresh and fragrant , Lisle and Alice were awaiting Grace to take a long ramble to a certain `` Prospect hill '' -- -LRB- the Puritan proscription of fancy extends even to names -RRB- that overlooks a long sweep of the Hudson , and hills , valleys , and lakes , to where the Kaatskills `` Shut in the exploring eye . '' 
There was some delay on Grace 's part . 
`` By ` womankind , ' you mean Grace or me , or perhaps both . 
`` Do , Amy , '' said Alice , `` see what keeps Miss Herbert . '' 
I can not stand seeing her so pale , and petrified ; it is a wretched out-of-joint world ; but there comes Grace at last ; take care , Archy , you are letting the silk slip . 
asked her mother , as she entered from the garden , following Grace . 
`` We have been waiting for Grace , mother . 
It 's hard waiting even for you , Grace ; truly , ` those serve who wait . ' '' 
While you have been impatient , Miss Herbert has been helping me to fill a basket with our late raspberries . '' 
While Grace went for her hat , Alice asked `` why she was not summoned to the raspberry-picking ? '' 
She did not notice Alice 's question , but said , `` The raspberries are for old Mrs. Denham -- just leave them , in your way , Alice , and take this lovely bouquet which Grace has tied up for me , to the sick girl at Smith 's . '' 
`` Ah , mother , you find Grace is not quite the superfluous fine lady you took her for one little month ago . '' 
`` I knew that temperament and training were against Grace , and I did not believe that she was strong enough to master them . 
I have not the prevailing habit of deferring to my juniors , but in regard to Grace , your instincts , Alice , were truer than my judgment . '' 
`` Dear , generous Mrs. Clifford , '' thought Lisle , `` it is plain that you are as ignorant as the rest of the world of Miss Herbert 's engagement ; if you were not , such praise would be keen irony to one who , instead of ` mastering , ' has weakly yielded to the worst and weakest of temptations . '' 
Grace came from her room equipped for the walk . 
Lisle bowed again -- not at all as if his head were turned by the `` compliment ; '' and Alice whispered to Grace , `` The fly in the ointment ; how shall we get rid of him ? '' 
`` Then you have bores , dear Alice , '' said Grace , `` even in these purlieus of Paradise ? '' 
`` Yes , Grace , indigenous bores . 
Archibald went manfully up to the stake , and replied , `` A very particular friend of mine , Alice , and an acquaintance of your 's , Miss Herbert -- Miss Adeline Clapp . '' 
`` Poor Mr. Lisle , '' said Grace ; `` there 's nothing for you but to drown yourself in Lily pond ! '' 
Poor Archibald -- these short passages alone with Grace , the last perhaps he might enjoy unfettered , seemed to him , like some moments between waking and sleeping , to comprise a life-time of thought and feeling . 
Did Alice ever tell you , Miss Herbert , how she tumbled off that bridge when she was a little thing -- not quite so tallas she is now ? '' 
added Grace , with a significant smile . 
`` You are a little taller than you were then , Alice , '' said Grace , smiling , `` but not a whit less a child . '' 
And Grace sighed as she made the same inference that Archibald had ; both were at fault . 
Alice was startled : `` Have I , '' she thought , `` betrayed any thing to Grace 's keen eye ? '' 
But as she met that eye , there was no `` speculation '' in it -- Grace was reading the painful secrets of her own heart . 
The scene was new to Grace , and the finest chords of her being responded to it , like an instrument to the touch of a master . 
The spirits of both Grace and Archibald were so raised above their ordinary level , that material things were glorified mediums to them ; poetry alone seemed a fit response to the outward influence . 
Grace would recite a favorite passage from a favorite poet ; Lisle responded with another -- the smallest phrase she uttered had its `` prosperity in his ear , '' an undefinable charm . 
She wandered off and plucked wild flowers , and returned to deck Grace 's hair with them ; if she spoke , it was of some fact or circumstance that seemed to Lisle not in harmony with the present scene of enchantment . 
She withdrew and sat apart . 
Suddenly it occurred to Lisle that she had felt the embarrassment of being a third party , and he started to his feet with a compunctious pang . 
Grace halted at a quagmire , over which Alice had leaped dry-shod . 
`` Oh , Alice , I ca n't do that feat , '' said Grace , with a dismay , half tragic , half comic . 
Here , just by , is a pile of cut wood , and we can soon make a bridge for Grace to pass over this great gulf ! '' 
-- enough , '' cried Grace . 
Perhaps Archibald was disconcerted by Grace placing them so distinctly , by her allusion to their quotation from Ferdinand , in the relation of lovers , or it might be the grasp of Grace 's hand ; he blundered , his foot slipped . 
Grace instinctively pulled away her hand , the bit of wood on which she stood so turned , that one of her feet was submerged . 
and an absurdly little foot , Grace , for a country scramble , '' and Archibald admiring , as men will , without any reference to its capabilities , the small beautiful foot `` bien chaussé . '' 
Grace was glad of time to recover from what she fancied was a slight sprain of her ankle , which she was eager to conceal , that it might not hinder their walk . 
Grace was obliged to confess the cause of her lingering . 
`` The road could not be far from them , and while he was gone , Miss Herbert might manage , with Alice 's assistance , to reach it ; or , still better , he would bring a man from the village to assist in bearing her to the carriage . '' 
You shall come with me , Archy , to the end of the wood , and then return to Grace , while I go to the village . '' 
This was agreed on , Grace protesting herself particularly pleased with the novelty of her position . 
Archibald and Alice traversed the wood in silence , and in a much shorter time than they expected , for they seemed not to have gone far beyond Grace 's hearing , when they reached the end of it , where the trees appeared as if they had filed off on each side to encircle a natural vestibule or entrance . 
She forgot herself , forgot Grace , and thinking only of averting the wretchedness impending over poor Amy and her people , she hastened on . 
She inquired for Miss Herbert , and on being told that she was with her friend , who was too much indisposed to see company , Miss Clapp asked for Mr. Lisle . 
We were sitting , the Major and me , talking over Washington , and saying what an interesting place it is , so many intelligent members , and such affable foreign ambassadors , and then we went off to speaking of Mrs. Tallis ; at least I was telling the Major -- he had never heard of her before -- how they had located in a lovely spot not far from Grace 's sister Esterly , and were after all -- you know , ma'am , probably what I allude to ? '' 
`` Well , how uncommon , that Grace has not told you about her , but I suppose she has feelings in that direction . 
Poor Miss Herbert had sprained her ankle coming down Prospect Hill -- she has a touch of the heroic , and she dragged along , upheld by Archy , to the road-side , where they were met by your man passing with your sublime ponies . 
So Lisle took possession , and drove Miss Herbert home . 
I hated the place from the moment Grace left the house ; and to return to it -- pah ! 
`` He has just gone to his room for the night , after talking much of you , and more of himself than I have heard him in his whole life before ; and think of it , dear Grace , he has explained the mystery of the letter we found in the green trunk ! 
How characteristic of dear Uncle Walter , Grace ; he always puts off the evil day . 
The words I have underscored were italicised ; it struck me there was some intimation in this , and I asked Uncle Walter ` if he knew any thing of her friends ? ' 
` Very little , ' he replied ; ` she sometimes spoke of a sister Judith ; and I remember once saying to her , `` You seem to stand much in awe of that sister of your 's ? '' 
She answered gently , `` She is much older than I -- a good sister , and a mother as well . '' 
Oh , Grace , Grace , what a miss you made of it ! ' 
``` But , dear uncle , ' I said -LRB- I could not help putting in a word for you , Grace -RRB- , ` Archibald was never Grace 's lover . ' 
` How do you like , ' I asked him , ` the fashion in which Grace casts her future ? ' 
No one can have more than one chance in that line ; I had mine , Grace her 's : we both threw them away . 
Grace , if she married at all , would of course marry her inferior ; and Milton 's Adam spoke for all his children , when he said : ``` Among unequals , what society Can sort , what harmony or true delight ? ' '' 
After a dreary pause , while his mind went back to the sad disparity that has marred his life , he brightened , and said , ` Thank God , Grace 's star has not set -- such a light as her 's can not be hid ; she has lost the best prize in the lottery . 
Why , Grace , dear old Effie is a rebuke to whining wives and careless mothers , with her self-denying , lavish devotion to children , her gentle , kind doings of all sorts to her general family of human kind , and her cheerful economies of her small means of happiness . 
I have just sent for the doctor , '' she added in a lowered voice to Grace ; `` I do n't understand Alice 's condition -- she is not ill , but she seems fluttered , and flighty , and just now she was quite irritated at Max because he delayed in bringing her a letter from the mail -- of course there was no letter of any special interest to expect ; and when Max brought one , she did not even break the seal while I was in the room -- that dreadful fright has put her all out . '' 
`` She has seemed very cheerful since , '' replied Grace . 
Grace went on her errand . 
said Grace , as she entered her friend 's room , `` you do not look as if you needed the doctor ! '' 
asked Grace . 
Guess me that guess , dear Grace . '' 
The gravity of Grace 's face was a striking contrast to the playfulness of Alice , as she replied , `` Is it from Mr. Lisle ? '' 
No listening could have been more satisfactory than Grace 's now became . 
`` This letter you see , Grace , is directed to my mother . 
You must take it to her for me ; and you must give her some explanations before she reads it , which I will now make to you . 
I have my lovestory to tell you , Grace -- it 's very short , just begun indeed . 
She had married -- oh , long ago -- and married for love , Grace , a sort of wild Irishman , who took her by storm . 
He was handsome and eloquent , she said . 
She had quite a fortune from an aunt , and no parents , no protector , only one brother -- a boy then . 
Her husband turned out a drunkard , and every thing horrid . 
He squandered her fortune . 
In the first three years of her marriage , she had two boys born . 
Well , dear Grace , in this fiery furnace of affliction , there was an angel -- Mrs. Maltby 's brother Charles -- Charles Fletcher . '' 
Such a brother he was , Grace -- so cheerful , and yet so sympathizing , with such sweet heavenly thoughts for her , ` just the food she needed , ' she said . 
Oh , Grace , such a brother as he was ! '' 
said Grace , imitating Alice 's fervent tone . 
`` No , no , Grace . 
`` Yes , Grace , that is one of my facts.A few days before Mrs. Maltby died , she was thrown into spasms by a letter from her husband threatening to take possession of the children . 
I wrote to my mother to ask her co-operation ; a mere outline -- no ` filling-up , ' Grace . 
`` We could not help that , Grace ; nor could we help speaking when we met . '' 
To tell the truth , Grace , I was more delighted than surprised to see him . 
His expected arrival with commercial despatches was mentioned in a Californian letter , which my eye strangely fell upon the other evening , when I was looking over Archy 's shoulder at the gossip from Newport -- the time that I rushed out , and Archy followed me -- do you remember , Grace ? '' 
Grace nodded affirmatively . 
We exchanged some ten words , Grace -- just as good as ten volumes . 
Grace was the last person in the world to give a faint sympathy . 
said Alice , pausing , and looking steadfastly in Grace 's eyes , and smiling very archly , `` you are not wide awake yet , Grace -- but you soon will be ; it 's dawn now , daylight is coming . '' 
`` Give me the letter for your mother , '' said Grace , her heart smiling at Alice 's prognostic , if she controlled her lips ; `` I long to have my task over , Alice ; I dread her disappointment . '' 
Go , dear Grace ; my mother will be perfectly reconciled as soon as she knows Charles -- I am sure of that . '' 
Grace 's face was turned from her , or she would have seen the intimation in it that no man on earth could fill up the chasm made by the loss of Archibald . 
Grace stood with the door half open , awaiting Alice 's words ; she reclosed it . 
You need not confess , Grace -- your burning cheek tells his whole story , and I can tell it in two lines : `` You are a diviner , Alice . '' 
`` Oh no , Grace , we have been playing at child 's play -- French blindfold , and my wand alone touched the right person . 
Why , Grace , I have seen from the first day we were together in New York that he was in love with you ; I saw it in the glance of his eye , I heard it , Grace , in the tone of his voice . 
`` Youare not inspired , Alice , '' Grace replied , with rather a sad smile . 
`` To rise like a goddess from the waves , Grace , as soon as he knew you were free , and how nobly you had freed yourself . '' 
`` No , no , dear Alice , I 'll not have him challenged ; he must find out the truth before long , and then , if -- perhaps -- '' `` No ifsand perhapses , dear Grace . 
Grace returned to her uncle from her long interview with Mrs. Clifford , and told him his hostess begged to be excused till the morning . 
`` Upon my word , '' he said , looking into Grace 's eyes , where he saw the marks of recent tears , and yet , in her whole expression , the serenity of the securest happiness ; `` Upon my word , this is an odd place , this Mapleton -- breezy , showers , but no clouds . 
` Newport Items : -- The fashionables assembled at this world-renowned watering place , have been startled by the announcement of Mr. H. C ***** 's -LRB- the millionaire -RRB- engagement to the beautiful , rich , and accomplished Miss C ****** -LRB- `` six stars , Grace , after the C '' -RRB- . 
The contracting parties -LRB- with the bride elect 's intellectual mother -RRB- have left for New York , and are to be married privatelyin Grace Church . '' 
Walter Herbert looked where he always first looked for sympathy , to Grace , and exclaimed , `` Why , my child , you do not even look surprised . '' 
Let me see it , Grace . '' 
At the first indication of Copley 's name , Lisle 's eye instinctively turned to Grace 's face , and fell to perusing it as one reads a document for life or death , but he read nothing there : not a muscle moved ; there was no change from red to pale , or pale to red , till extending the letter toward her uncle , Lisle took it to pass it . 
assured Columbus of his fulfilled hope , we venture to say there was not a more effulgent joy in his face than in Archibald Lisle 's when Grace 's eye met his . 
-LRB- Then followed a deal of twaddle ; ` she trusted that Anne would not be dazzled with her brilliant future , and that she herself should `` continue humble , and occupied with her duties , ' '' etc. , etc. -RRB- The letter concluded , `` As I have often remarked , every thing ismixed in this world , and truly , my dear Grace , myhappiness is alloyed by the thought of yourdisappointment . 
But pardon me , dear Grace I would not hurt your feelings . 
We are well quit of them , dear Grace , Ah , friends ! 
`` Much , much better , '' said Grace , with an emphasis that startled Archibald from a reverie , in which hope beamed from a mass of bitter feelings , self-reproaches for past blindness , false judgments , fluctuating purposes , and compromises with the affections -- the affections of heavenly birth , and destiny , too sacred to be approached by that genius of universal tinkering -- compromise . 
asked May , who stood beside him on the sofa , extremely puzzled -- `` that you are an instrument to play on , like Grace 's piano ? '' 
`` Oh I like merry music -- I 'll have you , dear old Bagpipe , and play on you at Miss Alice 's wedding , and Grace 's wedding ! 
`` Grace 's wedding ! '' 
echoed Uncle Walter ; `` Grace will never have a wedding -- so she says , May . '' 
Grace , '' she called out to Miss Herbert , who was intent on a passage in a book to which Lisle , standing beside her , had called her attention , `` Grace , do n't you mean to be married , and have a wedding ? '' 
If Grace heard , she had no need to reply , for , luckily , May 's attention was diverted by Max 's entrance . 
Neither he nor Grace had heard one word of Max 's previous rattle , they being bent over the honeysuckle at the door-side , and apparently absorbed in a botanical investigation . 
The last of her ! 
No , she and our ultra fashionable friends , whose nuptials were solemnized in Grace Church , will be returned upon us by some foreign satirist -LRB- Thackeray , if such meat were fit for the gods -RRB- , as `` General Jeremiah E. Bangs and lady , '' or Mrs. Horace Copley -- as the case may be -- a fine lady `` from the States , '' who shall remark at a Baden ball that some future `` Miss Newcome 's toilette would do at a Fifth Avenue party , '' and these exceptional people will be received , by the European reading public , as illustrating specimens of the social results of democratic institutions . 
The twilight had deepened into night , the new moon had dropped behind the hills , the evening-star had followed her , Mars had traversed a broad space in the firmament , Jupiter had risen far enough above the horizon to drop a thread of light athwart the lake , and the lowest star in Orion shone over the eastern hills , when Archibald and Grace , who had been in the light of these skyey processes , but not observant of them , returned from floating on the lake in Max 's `` sulky . '' 
`` Oh , Grace , '' she said , `` why do n't you come to bed ? 
Grace kissed her , and smiled , but said nothing . 
May looked from Grace to Archibald : there too she met a smile of ineffable happiness , and the bright little creature , brightening all over , exclaimed exultant , `` Oh , I know -- I know you areto be married , Grace , and we shall have your wedding , and Uncle Walter will be my bagpipe . '' 
`` You remind me , my dear child , '' said Mrs. Clifford , after a long and satisfactory conversation the next day , with Grace , `` of a dear friend of mine -LRB- that unnamed friend was the great religious and moral writer who is acknowledged throughout Christendom as a beloved master and teacher -RRB- who , when he was a young man , addressed a letter to two young women , his intimate friends , adjuring them to consecrate themselves to a single life , in order to demonstrate how happy , beneficent , and honored it might be . 
He , not long after , married one of these young women , Grace . '' 
You are ` equal to either fortune , ' Grace , ` married or single . '
